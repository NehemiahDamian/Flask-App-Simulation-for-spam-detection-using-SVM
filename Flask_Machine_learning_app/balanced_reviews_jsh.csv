The quality of the felt is good, and the illustrations are detailed and pretty.  As noted, the figures and scenes are printed on 2 large sheets of flannel and each individual item needs to be cut out.  This process took me 2 hours of tiny cutting.  To me it does not lend itself to a book form but rather laying out the scenes separately or for use on a flannel board.  However, I love the quiet play it offers for my toddler, and as a former Kindergarten teacher, I understand the value of learning rhyme and its connection to future reading.

I bought this for my 6 year old son who wants to do a school talent show. The thrill he got when he threw it in the air and it popped open was awesome! It is indeed made of some sort of paper (kind of like a really thick mylar material), but I have to say after rolling it up and tossing it in the air 30 or more times in one night, it still looks great! Also, while it is paper, I do not think it looks like paper at all when being used. You would really have to hold it to know that it wasn't metal or plastic.I give this product 4 stars because I do believe the product description should state what kind of material it is made of. If you just go by the picture it looks to be plastic. So, I can understand the frustration of others if a more solid wand is what they were looking for. Also, it is not that easy to roll at first but once you break it in a bit, it gets much easier.

This book was well recommended by a number of sources, so I got it with several other books. I am quite pleased with Colette Pitcher's presentation in this book.The other books tend to skim topics as if they're unimportant, and leap right into twelve-part petals. Colette takes it slow. She explains how transparent watercolors are see-through, while opaque (non-see-through) watercolors tend to have Chinese white in them. And then there are acrylics, which are also opaque, but these dry solidly. They won't re-wet. These kinds of details are important, quite helpful, and other similar books don't seem to cover them.She talks about how old watercolors had issues with fading in light, but that newer ones are much sturdier. That a key to watercolor's luminosity is that light shines through the transparent layers, bounces off the paper behind it, and reflects back at our eyes, giving it a glow. She talks not only about painting, but about spattering, using non-brush objects to make textures, and much more.She covers the emotions of painting. She says ""art tends to be stuffy, pretentious, and cerebral."" Instead, she pushes us to be relaxed and free. Practice every day, even for a few minutes. Buy inexpensive but good quality gear - don't let yourself quit out of frustration with cheap, inferior tools. Play with ""blooming"" paint and other ""errors"". Make your own color charts to know how your particular paints work. And, most of all, have patience. Let yourself rediscover a child-like awe of the world.She gives guidance on showing your artwork. Use white mats for art shows, and avoid cardboard / newsprint backings as the acid will damage the watercolor paper.

But, I am going to borrow it.  I call it sharing.I ordered several of these - different designs - but all by Dover and Marty Noble.  Of all of them, this is my favorite DESIGN  - but least favorite layout.  It doesn't take up the entire page like the rest of the books do. The design is in the center, and there is quite a bit of white, blank page, left all around it on every side.  What you see on the cover, is probably the biggest design in all of the book.  I will try to get a picture of the inside in the next few days, and post it here for you to see.Despite that, I do love the design.  (Just wish it were bigger, taking up more of the page.)  I love coloring.  It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just like to color.  I love that I have small children still (9 and 2) that I can color with, without looking completely silly (Not that I'd really care).  Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies, and coloring books for my 17-year-old. (I typed in 'coloring book for teens' on a whim).  And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble.  The price was reasonable, and the quality is nice.  It's not a thick (lots of pages) coloring book like you would find for small children, only around 40 pages, I think.  But the pages aren't thin like a child's coloring book either.  They are a little thicker.  A little better quality.  Nice bold white sheets.  I'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through, but I don't know for sure yet.

The card in the back of the box that tells how to introduce the characters, letters, best friends, objects, etc. was really helpful and the games that are included were so much fun for my little one (Rhyme Time, Letterlicious, and Alphabotz Story Tag were big hits!).

It is a two player game where one side plays the Lord of Pestilence (the diseases) and another plays the Apothecary Healers (the medicinal agents for countering the diseases). It was developed by two medical doctors who also happen to be gamers, Francis Kong and Arun Mathews. From what I've read, it is growing in popularity with medical students.When I first heard about this, the first thing I thought of was an academic paper my wife had ran across and told me about by Richard Steinman and Mary Blastos called ""A trading-card game teaching about host defence"" from 2002. The paper concluded concluded that the game was super-effective for teaching the concepts. The two are unrelated, to my knowledge, but share the same conceptual space. Both the game in the paper and The Healing Blade are games... that teach. But on to this game.It's a beautiful game. It has high-quality components, and great art. There are 20 green glass beads included to track the energy resource used, ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Each player has a full-color playmat. And most of the 90 cards have unique art. The art is definitely worth mentioning here... it would definitely hold its own against Magic: The Gathering art. Gorgeous illustratiuons. Altogether, a very impressive set of components.And then... the cards. Okay, here is where the diseases come in. Each Lord of Pestilence card has the full scientific name of the disease (Streptococcus pneumoniae or Helicobacter pylori, as examples), its abbreviated common name (S. pneumoniae, H. pylori) and a fantasy-style piece of art that represents it, plus flavortext that puts a magical spin on its real-world effect. Each Apothecary Healer card has the name of a medicine (ie, Doxycyclene) and its own art and flavortext. Aside from a small font, they are very well put together.As for gameplay... let's say that this was the funnest study session I've ever had on infectious diseases. Which is to say that as a game, the mechanics do leave a little to be desired. The rules are pretty concise and simple, but in playing we found a couple situations not covered in the rules. For instance, as the Lord of Pestilence, I found my hand of cards clogged with high-cost diseases that I was unable to play. The result was that my Apothecary Healer opponent was able to build up and have a healer combatant that could counter most diseases I could play. It could have just been a bad run, and I noticed on their site a rules revision is in progress. So... the current gameplay isn't tight, mechanics-wise... but as I see it, that's not an issue. Because mechanics are not the point.What this game represents is a great step in the right direction for games that teach. If I were a medical student, I would absolutely love this game. This beats the heck out of a dry textbook. Granted, it doesn't replace the textbook, but it is a great supplement that presents the material in a way that activates different parts of the brain. This would be a great supplement to a class on pathogens. It slaps a fun theme on the subject of infectious diseases and how to fight them, and runs with it. I hands-down recommend this for any med student out there. For gamers? Not so much. But keep your eye out: the next rules revision may very well put this mechanically closer to the games we play just for fun. I suspect we may start seeing more hobby-quality games whose primary purpose is to help us learn.

You can add more tiles to the twenty-four you are initially alloted, so as long as it works out that each player would receive an equal amount of turns.  If you have four players for example, you could add twenty-eight or thirty-two tiles instead.  You can opt to play a longer game, or you can play the standard game which lasts about an hour, sometimes less, depending on how quick players are in forming words.The variant listed in the manual is a welcome addition to the main game and was received well by my son and me.  It gave us more options in the beginning, as we were often struggling to find words using the normal setup.  The variant also suggests the use of a sand timer (not included in the main game) to help speed things along, which is a good idea if you are pressed for time.  I normally leave out timers in the games we review to encourage the kids to think about all of their options.Since there are seventy-one tiles and you are using less than a third of them in each game, the replay value ends up being extremely high.  Add the fact that you have pawns blocking each other's movements and bonus tiles that provide various effects...two games end up never being the same.Aside from its replayability, it is very educational.  This game forces players to expand their vocabulary and adapt to the letters that they are presented with.  This would be an excellent game for kids as it promotes learning and creative thinking.  Using this game as a practice aid for spelling and vocabulary in the classroom is very doable.  The teacher (or parent) could pick and choose which twenty-four tiles are in the game, based on the kinds of words that they are practicing at the time.My son struggled at first, not understanding the difference between laying a tile down and starting a word where the pawn was.  He quickly came to see after a few turns however that you can strategically place your letter tiles in such a way that your pawn could utilize it.  The game went very quickly (about thirty minutes) and we tied at fifty-nine points each.  For our first game, I stacked the ""deck"" with more greens and yellows to help ease him into learning the game.  He was trying out different letter combinations and sometimes asked if what he proposed was a word...which is exactly the kind of interaction that I was hoping would result from playing together.  He was being encouraged to think outside of the box and expand his vocabulary...a plus for any parent worth his (or her) two cents.Overall, this is an excellent game to introduce to your family on family game night.  Its high replayability allows for hours of fun, while keeping your mind and vocabulary sharp in the process.",4.0,WayWord Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,WayWord 2 4 player age 10 + average play time = 30 60 minuteslike experience Got like flexible game allow   add tile initially allot long work player receive equal turn   player example add thirty tile instead   opt play long game play standard game last hour depend quick player form word variant list manual welcome addition main game receive son   give option beginning struggle find word normal setup   variant suggest use sand timer include main game help speed thing good idea press time   normally leave timer game review encourage kid think option seventy tile game replay value end extremely high   add fact pawn block movement bonus tile provide effect game end aside replayability educational   game force player expand vocabulary adapt letter present   excellent game kid promote learning creative thinking   game practice aid spelling vocabulary classroom doable   teacher parent pick choose tile game base kind word practice time son struggle understand difference lay tile start word pawn   quickly come turn strategically place letter tile way pawn utilize   game go quickly thirty minute tie point   game stack deck green yellow help ease learn game   try different letter combination ask propose word exactly kind interaction hope result play   encourage think outside box expand vocabulary plus parent worth cent overall excellent game introduce family family game night   high replayability allow hour fun keep mind vocabulary sharp process

Let's find out together.When you first open the box, you will see a small rule book and a sheet that teach you how to set the game up in detail, this is a plus from the get go since they don't want to confuse you from the beginning.This game is played in 15 rounds, a player has to balance his time/action between work, service, extracurricular, and/or academics to get a better chance of getting into the colleges he or she wants to go. While a person is balancing these 4 items, they are also competing with each other on scholarships and getting into selective schools that have very limited opening so they can maximize they point at the end of the game.One thing I like about this game the cards are not generic cards that simply says work, service, extracurricular,  academics, they actually have very detail description of what that role does, i,e, a SERVICE card says Volunteer Soup Kitchen, one could earn PERSONAL STORIES and LETTERS OF REC if he/she decide to put enough time into it and these elements are helpful in applying for colleges and/or scholarships later on in the game.Perhaps another WORK card says you are a LION TAMER could potentially earn you lots of MONEY, PERSONAL STORIES and LETTER OF REC. A EXTRACURRICULARS card could be MODERN DANCE, SNOWBOARDING, ULTIMATE FRISBEE or a GAME design.You get the idea of this game, so is this a good game? I would say this is a great tool for those student just enter high school in their 9th and 10th grade who can prepare their college application process early. Although you can play this game in less than an hour but when you are actually preparing in real life will take a couple of years to build your portfolio to apply for colleges.And did I mention the maker of this game is University of Southern California ???

I've written an extensive session report on how to use Twilight Struggle in the classroom based on a class project a few years back and have been as outspoken as possible every where I can to pursue the use of other good games for the same reason. Perhaps because of this, a while ago I was approached by the makers of this game to play and review it.(I did receive a complimentary copy to do so)This is my first board game review, so please bear with me. In order to do so, I wanted to take advantage of playing with the target audience of the game--my 17 1/2 year old nephew who's a good kid, does well in school, but is very apathetic about pretty much everything, including getting ready and applied to college.Components: The game comes in a fairly small, compact box and has good quality card stock cards. The artwork and colors are very utilitarian and have a good education look that is nice and I enjoy it. You will need a bunch of paper clips on hand as these are used to track info on the cards. I'd recommend plastic or coated ones so as not to scrape up the cards any as you slide them up and down.The Basic Premise: The goal of Application Crunch is just that, to show high school students the process of how to apply to college in a way that makes sense, is fun and interesting. It's played over a series of rounds using cards and action points in a variety of ways to track the progress of the players in multiple facets of their high school life and 'sending' those trackers off to achieve different rewards, ultimately resulting in applying and hopefully being accepted at the type of college you believe will bring you the most victory points.How it Works: To start, everyone draws a character card, a family finances card and two envelopes. Each character has a special ability to give them a slight leg up in different aspects of the game. Each player in turn draws a productivity card telling them how many action points they get along with some fun, light flavor text in the mood of a typical HS kid's week. The player then uses those action points to either draw cards, move up a level on the cards they already have, or add cards to your envelopes and/or add the envelopes to an event or college (thus 'applying' to that school).The cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service along with question cards which work a little differently. Each of these activities have levels and theme appropriate names that provide benefits for achieving them. The higher up, the better and more versatile--more cash, awards, etc. This is where the paper clips are used to track that information. The question cards are drawn and asked by the active player. These are open ended trivia-type questions about getting ready for college and/or applying. A few answers are on each card but I'd say it's pretty much up to the group which are best and who should get the rewards, usually a free level up.After all players have taken all their actions, a new event or college is put into play to be applied to and the last one in the line is set aside. Those whose envelopes were submitted to that event/college are opened and its determined who were admitted and/or given other awards.Once all events/colleges have gone through this process, the game is over and you determine who won. You have to have enough money to go to the college you end up selecting that you got into. Each college gives you victory points according to the different icons you achieved and which school you went to. So, a technical school will give you more points for awards in engineering and science while a private school will emphasize high grades.Whoever has the most points is the winner.My take: The game was surprisingly cohesive and enjoyable and my nephew felt the same way. You learn much about the application process and what it entails to get into the college of your choice. The game is fairly quick and simple but has many interesting decisions to make. I liked how it showed how you need to balance your life between, academics, work and extracurricular activities. The trivia cards are great, too, as they can start good discussions about what to expect and what needs to be done. However, I do think they would work much better with 3-4 players. The icons were easy to read and the rules are fairly easy to follow. The end game scoring is a bit of math, but that's good anyway, right?Overall, Application Crunch is a well designed game that achieves its purpose in that it is both informative/educational and fun to play. My nephew and I both agree that it would not be our first, second or third choice to play off the game shelf as it really isn't that kind of fun. However, to be used for its intended purpose, it gets high marks. I'd highly recommend it to any and every education counselor (or any youth counselor, really), ecclesiastic leader, teacher or any friend or relative concerned with the prospects of their family members in high school.",4.0,"Educating in a Non-boring way (Yes, it's fun AND useful!)",1332288000,"03 21, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1,get gaming real hobby school teacher passionate game educational tool classroom write extensive session report use Twilight Struggle classroom base class project year outspoken possible pursue use good game reason ago approach maker game play review it.(i receive complimentary copy so)this board game review bear order want advantage play target audience game 17 1/2 year old nephew good kid school apathetic pretty include get ready apply college component game come fairly small compact box good quality card stock card artwork color utilitarian good education look nice enjoy need bunch paper clip hand track info card recommend plastic coated one scrape card slide Basic Premise goal Application Crunch high school student process apply college way make sense fun interesting play series round card action point variety way track progress player multiple facet high school life send tracker achieve different reward ultimately result apply hopefully accept type college believe bring victory point work start draw character card family finance card envelope character special ability slight leg different aspect game player turn draw productivity card tell action point fun light flavor text mood typical HS kid week player use action point draw card level card add card envelope and/or add envelope event college apply school).The card divide extracurricular academic work service question card work little differently activity level theme appropriate name provide benefit achieve high well versatile cash award etc paper clip track information question card draw ask active player open end trivium type question get ready college and/or apply answer card pretty group good reward usually free level player take action new event college play apply line set aside envelope submit event college open determined admit and/or give award event college go process game determine win money college end select get college give victory point accord different icon achieve school go technical school point award engineering science private school emphasize high grade point winner game surprisingly cohesive enjoyable nephew feel way learn application process entail college choice game fairly quick simple interesting decision like show need balance life academic work extracurricular activity trivium card great start good discussion expect need think work well 3 4 player icon easy read rule fairly easy follow end game scoring bit math good right?Overall Application Crunch design game achieve purpose informative educational fun play nephew agree second choice play game shelf kind fun intend purpose get high mark highly recommend education counselor youth counselor ecclesiastic leader teacher friend relative concerned prospect family member high school

In my experience, games that are specifically designed to be educational often lack any actual gameplay.Thankfully, this was not the case with Application Crunch. The game plays with a very ""Eurogame"" feel with cards dictating the number of actions you get each turn. Each player also has a character class, which is essentially a high school clique stereotype that gives that player a small advantage for performing various actions.Overall my students and I enjoyed the game. It had a surprising amount of decisions to be made while still playing quickly and not leading to any kind of over-analysis that can bog down a game. It also very much gave a feel of that senior year rush when a student has 20 things they want to do and only 4 hours of free time. All that was conveyed well and drove home the importance of prioritizing.So overall, this game is a fantastic recommendation for a high school club - or even better a guidance office. The only drawback is it still has a deck of cards that ask questions about preparing for college. That gives it the scent of ""educational"" game that scares off many of my kids from voluntarily playing it when they are faced with an entire cabinet of choices.So I would rate it 5 stars as an educational game. And 4 stars as a game where education isn't the primary goal.",4.0,Good game - especially for an educational game!,1332288000,"03 21, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1,receive copy Application Crunch play academic game club go somewhat low expectation experience game specifically design educational lack actual gameplay thankfully case Application Crunch game play Eurogame feel card dictate number action turn player character class essentially high school clique stereotype give player small advantage perform action overall student enjoy game surprising decision play quickly lead kind analysis bog game give feel senior year rush student 20 thing want 4 hour free time convey drive home importance prioritize overall game fantastic recommendation high school club well guidance office drawback deck card ask question prepare college give scent educational game scare kid voluntarily play face entire cabinet choice rate 5 star educational game 4 star game education primary goal

It helps that many of the rules don't kick in until after everybody has taken four turns around the table.It is basically an occupy and hold game for 3 to 5 players, set in 19th Century New York City.  No dice, very little randomness, with elements of bluffing, negotiation, and intimidation.  You occupy wards with a combination of placing ward bosses, and backing them up with political favor tokens.  You earn political favors by bringing immigrants ashore and then organizing them in your wards. There are four immigrant groups, each player will try to control one or two of these groups as she battles to win mayoral elections over a 16-year period.Players can form alliances to beat up whoever is ahead, but if you devote too many resources to these political fights you may lose control of your own base and fall behind your consolidating competitors.Give it a try!",5.0,"Simple mechanics, complex interactions",1376179200,"08 11, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,boardgamer buddy game easy learn appear open box   help rule kick everybody take turn table basically occupy hold game 3 5 player set 19th Century New York City   dice little randomness element bluffing negotiation intimidation   occupy ward combination place ward boss back political favor token   earn political favor bring immigrant ashore organize ward immigrant group player try control group battle win mayoral election 16 year period player form alliance beat ahead devote resource political fight lose control base fall consolidate competitor try

The game consists of cards, a quick set up guide, a rule book, and some envelopes.  You will need to provide some paperclips in order to play.  I was impressed by the components.  The cards are good quality, nicely designed, and easy to read.  I liked the colors and the layout of the cards.The one issue that I had with components is that you will be putting paper clips on your cards and moving them up and down.  We used metal paper clips and this scratched the cards.  This doesn't really affect game-play; it's more of an aesthetics issue.  I would make sure that you use plastic or coated paper clips when you play.The goal of the game is to apply to different colleges throughout the game.  At the end of the game you will decide which college to attend based on which colleges accepted you.  After you decide which college to attend you will score points based on how you played throughout the game.  The player with the most points wins.At the beginning of the game everyone draws a character card and a family finances card.  The different characters give special abilities.  For example, the die hard can take five actions when he draws a card that only gives him 3 actions.  Your family finance card can give you some bonus cash to start with.Each turn you draw a productivity card that tells you how many action points you will have.  The cards have amusing flavor text, such as the Up Late Gaming Card; ""It's 3am - time to put down the controller.""  The productivity cards all have what actions can be used for printed on them, which was a nice touch.Actions are used to do many things.  You can draw activity cards.  The activity cards are divided into extracurricular, academics, work, and service.  You can also use an action to level up one of your activity cards.  This is just like leveling up a planeswalker in Magic, the Gathering.  Each activity card has different levels to it.  Some of the levels have icons that represent letters of recommendations, good grades, money, or other bonuses.  To level up a card you spend the actions that it specifies on the card and you move your paper clip up that level.Actions can also be used to draw question cards.  You read the question to all of the players and let them answer it.  The questions are all related to college, such as ""What is the difference between AA, BA, and BS degrees?""  When you ask a question you get to level up an academic card one level.  You also get to decide which player had the best answer to the question and they also get to level up an academic card.  The question cards have answers to the questions printed on them, so that kids can compare the answers they hear with what's on the card.You can also use actions to put cards in your application envelopes and to put your envelope next to a college or event.  There is a series of cards that come out during the game.  These represent colleges and other things, such as college fairs and financial aid.  To apply for these things you use an action to ""submit"" an envelope next to one.  Every turn you look through the envelopes of the players that applied to that school to see who got in.At the end of the game everyone looks through the schools that they were accepted to and decides which one to attend.  You must have acquired enough money to pay for that school by the end of the game.  You then calculate your score based on how you have leveled up your cards throughout the game.  Each school gives you points depending on how many icons you have earned throughout the game.  For example art school will give points for cards that have levels of fine art, while the selective state school gives more points for academics.I played a two player game with a friend who likes Eurogames.  The game is for 3-4 players but we were just trying to figure out how everything worked.  We found that the mechanics worked together well.  My friend liked how asking a question was a good way to game the system, as you could level up a card for one action when some cards required two actions to level up.I played another game with the same friend and two high school students.  One student was a senior and had already applied and been accepted to college.  The other student was a sophomore and hasn't started applying to schools.  Both students said that this wasn't the kind of game that they would choose to play for fun.  However, they both said that they enjoyed playing it and that it taught them a lot about the application process.  They said that it showed how one had to be well rounded and balance things like academics and work.  They also really seemed to enjoy the question cards, which brought up some good discussion.Things I really liked about the game:I liked the leveling up mechanic.I liked the little envelopes.  My 5 year old daughter almost ran away with them when she saw them.I liked how the game forces you to think about different aspects of applying to college.  You are forced to look at your money situation, grades, service activities, and the like.  The students I played with said that it was eye opening to see that they had to focus on so many different things when looking into college.I would recommend this game to anyone who works with college bound students.  Playing the game can be a great springboard for discussion.  I liked how the game made the students think concretely about something that can seem abstract and distant.  College seemed almost like a myth when I was in high school.  It was something that I would eventually go to and that was all I really thought about it.  This game does a good job of providing hooks for students to use when thinking about college.  They can gain some insight to navigating the application process.  Any game that can be fun and teach  at the same time is a good game in my opinion.",5.0,Increase Your College Knowledge,1331251200,"03 9, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1,disclaimer receive complimentary copy game publisher Application Crunch game design teach student process apply college   game consist card quick set guide rule book envelope   need provide paperclip order play   impress component   card good quality nicely design easy read   like color layout card issue component put paper clip card move   metal paper clip scratch card   affect game play aesthetic issue   sure use plastic coated paper clip play goal game apply different college game   end game decide college attend base college accept   decide college attend score point base play game   player point win beginning game draw character card family finance card   different character special ability   example die hard action draw card give 3 action   family finance card bonus cash start turn draw productivity card tell action point   card amusing flavor text late gaming card 3 time controller   productivity card action print nice touch action thing   draw activity card   activity card divide extracurricular academic work service   use action level activity card   like level planeswalker Magic Gathering   activity card different level   level icon represent letter recommendation good grade money bonus   level card spend action specify card paper clip level action draw question card   read question player let answer   question relate college difference AA BA BS degree   ask question level academic card level   decide player good answer question level academic card   question card answer question print kid compare answer hear card use action card application envelope envelope college event   series card come game   represent college thing college fair financial aid   apply thing use action submit envelope   turn look envelope player apply school get end game look school accept decide attend   acquire money pay school end game   calculate score base level card game   school give point depend icon earn game   example art school point card level fine art selective state school give point academic play player game friend like Eurogames   game 3 4 player try figure work   find mechanic work   friend like ask question good way game system level card action card require action level play game friend high school student   student senior apply accept college   student sophomore start apply school   student say kind game choose play fun   say enjoy play teach lot application process   say show rounded balance thing like academic work   enjoy question card bring good discussion thing like game like level mechanic like little envelope   5 year old daughter run away see like game force think different aspect apply college   force look money situation grade service activity like   student play say eye opening focus different thing look college recommend game work college bind student   play game great springboard discussion   like game student think concretely abstract distant   College like myth high school   eventually think   game good job provide hook student use think college   gain insight navigate application process   game fun teach   time good game opinion

I recommend it for a group of competitive players who enjoy some healthy tension and getting political.It is important to note that it has a rather high skill cap and is the type of game in which the more experienced players can win pretty easily. They will understand the most advantageous locations to seek as well as the best way to use or distribute the city council powers. Less experienced players will have a tough time making the most of their very limited resources.Half of the fun is in the real world politics (appropriate for the theme). Forming alliances, and sometimes breaking them, is sometimes necessary to take out whoever is in the lead. Fights for territories can not be avoided, and they often occur between ""alliances."" This constant conflict is by far the biggest reason why this game gets so tense. I get so nervous with each turn, that it can truly stress me out.In response to those who claim that the game is unbalanced and that it is impossible for one to ""bounce back"" after losing, I will admit that it is extremely difficult. However, it is certainly not impossible, and it does not mean that the ""loser"" will not have any fun.

Some even go so far as to accuse Tammany of connivance in this so-called rampant criminality. What am I to do? I can't have this. Something has to be done.""Tammany Hall is one of the simplest and one of the most viciously political games I have played. These two statements seem contradictory so let's take a look.The Basics - ""You see this knife? I'm gonna teach you to speak English with this ****ing knife!""Tammany Hall is a political control board game in which you play out the unprincipled battles for votes in New York in the late nineteenth century. Using muscle, political tricks and skullduggery you aim to crush your rival and emerge as the dominant political power in Old New York. To do this each turn you can either drop two heavies onto the board (to ensure votes come your way in a precinct) or drop one heavy and move some poor befuddled immigrants into an area (which gets you political influence).  See just a choice of two actions ... easy right?Well after four turns of this there's an election to see who gets mayor (and lots of bonus points). The elections run ward by ward across the city and you win elections by counting up your heavies (who are guaranteed to 'arrange' the vote for you) and blind bidding political influence chips. And this is it gets really, really fun. You stare your friends in the eye and casually explain how you will BURN them if they dare to try contesting the election. You calmly point out that if they fight you here they will lose the next wards they are fighting for and have NOTHING. They of course calmly counter that they have been so kind to the immigrants that their voting power is unassailably and you should beg forgiveness.  Then you reveal your hidden chips and the winners yells out in victory!The Twist - ""The appearance of law must be upheld, especially when it's being broken.""After the election the player with the most wards is declared mayor and scoops up enough victory points to cement their lead. Then they must assign political offices to each of the losers -- these offices are powerful in that they allow these coat-tail grabbing to cheat! To protect a ward from influence, to arrest (remove) immigrant populations, to provide free housing (move populations around) and even just rack in extra influence for doing nothing! And these scoundrels will use their political offices to tear you down -- you! the one who gave them the offices. Ungrateful curs!And More! - ""That, my friends, is the minority vote.""You can slander an opponent forcing his heavies out of a ward and throwing their political machine into confusion. You can control an immigrant population and win even more influence. There are bonus wards which, when won, change the political landscape. Ah, it's tricky rising to the top in old New York!The Play - ""If you get all of us together, we ain't got a gang, we've got an army.""It's a really tight, really focused game. You never have resources to do what you want to do and the other players always have the ability to take down the leader.Now there is one problem in play in that if a player fails utterly in the early round it is impossible for them to catch up alone. And this is the key, the last player should parlay his status as a wild card (he has nothing to lose) to team up with the second player to take down the leader. If you work alone you are either the leader (and crushing all before you -- good luck with that) or you are missing opportunities to ally and snatch victory. Once you've learned to team up (like ragged hyenas) and then turn on your allies in an instant you've learned to play this game.The Box - ""Remember the first rule of politics. The ballots don't make the results, the counters make the results. The counters. Keep counting.""The components (box, board, meeples) are really nice. The only flaw is that you get a sheet of stickers to place on the political favor chips with the flag of the nation (Germany, England, Ireland, Italy) and that's fiddly.Summary - ""Mulberry Street... and Worth... Cross and Orange... and Little Water. Each of the Five Points is a finger. When I close my hand it becomes a fist. And, if I wish, I can turn it against you.""Our group started to use the phrase ""You've been Tammany Hall'd"" to describe when someone had been crushed in other games.

They allow children to open up in a playful way, and create wonderful conversation starters between kids and adults.  With my own child, they are a fun way to chat and learn new things about each other.  With kids and families in therapy, they create opportunities to assess needs and deepen relationships between family members, or between client and therapist.There are so many ways to use them, too!  You can just draw from the deck and shre, or you can pair these cards with another favorite game.  For example, I sometimes bring the cards out along with Checkers or Chess, and anytime someone loses a game piece to the other player, they draw a card and complete the sentence.  I have also paired the cards with Jenga, Don't Break the Ice, Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, and many other childhood games.Kids love the adorable artwork, and the fact that they can answer their own way makes these cards a non-threatening way to get to know someone new or deepen a relationship with someone trusted.I highly recommend this and other Bright Spots products to anyone with children from about age three (adults read the card aloud for the child) to adult.",5.0,Wonderful product I've used for years!,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,parent teacher counselor therapist card have!I purchase card time year professional personal use gift   allow child open playful way create wonderful conversation starter kid adult   child fun way chat learn new thing   kid family therapy create opportunity assess need deepen relationship family member client therapist way use   draw deck shre pair card favorite game   example bring card Checkers Chess anytime lose game piece player draw card complete sentence   pair card Jenga break Ice Candyland chute ladder childhood game kid love adorable artwork fact answer way make card non threatening way know new deepen relationship trust highly recommend bright spot product child age adult read card aloud child adult

Most of them could be played without actually having to buy anything, and most of the best party games don't require any components at all (like Truth or Dare, Have You Ever, or Quarters. OK, Quarters has components, but not many game companies are going to start selling rolls of quarters and pitchers of beer). The end result is that, while I see lots of party games, I don't tend to like very many of them.The Game of Things, from Hasbro, is one I like. In fact, it's one of the few I break out on a regular basis. It has the potential for a huge amount of hilarious fun, and it's equally playable with a room full of teenagers or a geriatric nursing home. Like nearly every party game ever, it relies on not playing with idiots to have fun, but I think that applies to nearly anything, from Risk to water-skiing (there are exceptions - it can be hilarious to play Red Light, Green Light with a retard).In Things (I'm abbreviating the name because I'm lazy), you've got a big deck of descriptions. These descriptions might be 'Things you would like to do with chocolate', or 'Things you would do if you could change genders for a day'. One person reads the description out loud, and everyone writes a thing that would be an answer, like 'eat it' or 'play Darjeeling.' Then you go around the table and take turns guessing who wrote what.Like most party games, the actual scoring is almost completely irrelevant. You don't really care who wins. The point is to hang out and have fun with people you may or may not like, unless you're playing with my father-in-law, in which case the point is to be as horribly inappropriate as possible (when asked for 'Things you wish you could check out in the library', he wrote 'the librarian'. In all fairness, I wrote 'whiskey and whores,' so it was kind of a tie for worst place).It's tough to write an in-depth review of a game as simple as The Game of Things. You read a card, everyone writes an answer, then you guess who wrote what. That's really it. It's not like there's strategy, outside playing like my son and writing answers that sound like someone else wrote them (like for 'Things cannibals think about while dining,' he wrote, 'I wish I had a good dark beer,' and everyone thought I wrote that. I wrote 'Mmm, tastes like chicken.') But even though it's not very deep, if you can get the right crowd of miscreants together, this can be a lot of fun. I've laughed myself through dozens of games of Things, although it's not always safe to play with kids (especially if you're playing with people who would answer 'Things you should not photograph' with 'your junk'. Like me).Apparently, Hasbro was trying to appeal to collector-types when they made The Game of Things, because it comes in a really nice wooden box. There's no reason it couldn't have come in a cardboard box like every other game, but the wooden slide-top box is a really nice touch. And the pretty box makes people think it must be better than other games, which it really is not, but they don't know that, so they'll play with you.On a scale that goes from Strip Spin the Bottle to Apples to Apples, The Game of Things falls somewhere around Taboo. It's a good time, but not as much fun as being 19 and getting naked with a roomful of pretty girls while you drink yourself into a stupor. But then, you can play Things with your in-laws, and if you play Strip Anything with your in-laws, please don't tell me about it.",5.0,Party Game Review - The Game of Things,1281744000,"08 14, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,pretty skeptical party game rehash crap play actually have buy good party game require component like Truth Dare quarter ok Quarters component game company go start sell roll quarter pitcher beer end result lot party game tend like Game Things Hasbro like fact break regular basis potential huge hilarious fun equally playable room teenager geriatric nursing home like nearly party game rely play idiot fun think apply nearly risk water skiing exception hilarious play Red Light Green Light retard).in thing abbreviate lazy get big deck description description thing like chocolate thing change gender day person read description loud write thing answer like eat play Darjeeling table turn guess write like party game actual scoring completely irrelevant care win point hang fun people like play father law case point horribly inappropriate possible ask thing wish check library write librarian fairness write whiskey whore kind tie bad place).It tough write depth review game simple Game Things read card write answer guess write like strategy outside play like son write answer sound like write like thing cannibal think dining write wish good dark beer think write write mmm taste like chicken deep right crowd miscreant lot fun laugh dozen game thing safe play kid especially play people answer thing photograph junk like me).apparently Hasbro try appeal collector type Game Things come nice wooden box reason come cardboard box like game wooden slide box nice touch pretty box make people think well game know play scale go Strip Spin bottle Apples Apples Game Things fall Taboo good time fun 19 get naked roomful pretty girl drink stupor play thing law play Strip law tell

Many excuses are given, but it is important to start this education while kids are young and the Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank is a good place to start. This bank does more than just encourage kids to save money- it also helps to develop a sense of charity and frugality.How does this bank accomplish so much? It does this through its modified design, which includes three different slots: One for Spend; one for Save; and one for Share. When money is dropped into one of the three slots, it is collected in a separate chamber. This separation and the three different options help to teach kids about saving for the future, saving money for a large purchase, and sharing money with others.What I like most about this bank is that it encourages kids to think about the different uses for money and the importance of giving. It is a simple design and concept and the three different slots and labels encourage kids to ask questions. It sparks their curiosity and gets them thinking about money, different ways to save, charity, etc. It shows kids that there is much more to money than simply spending it today and hoping for more tomorrow.As for cons, I can think of only a few issues with this bank and the main issue I have is with the physical size. The bank is only about 4.5 inches in diameter and the individual chambers will fill up in no time. This could discourage some kids to save more money. Once a chamber is full, some kids will immediately want to empty the compartment and use the money. I am also not too sure about the small padlock. Unless a child has untrustworthy siblings, I don't think a lock is necessary. Not only that, but the lock is small and the keys are tiny- It would be very easy to accidentally lose these keys.Financial education is important and the Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank is a simple yet effective device for teaching kids the value of a dollar. It would be nice if it was a little bit larger, but it is still a good savings bank and its educational value goes far beyond the basics.",4.0,Ballerina Money Bank Encourages Financial Education,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1,teach kid money important personal finance neglect parent time start educational process excuse give important start education kid young Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank good place start bank encourage kid save money- help develop sense charity frugality bank accomplish modify design include different slot Spend Save Share money drop slot collect separate chamber separation different option help teach kid save future save money large purchase share money like bank encourage kid think different use money importance giving simple design concept different slot label encourage kid ask question spark curiosity get think money different way save charity etc show kid money simply spend today hope tomorrow con think issue bank main issue physical size bank 4.5 inch diameter individual chamber fill time discourage kid save money chamber kid immediately want compartment use money sure small padlock child untrustworthy sibling think lock necessary lock small key tiny- easy accidentally lose key financial education important Mudpuppy Ballerina Money Bank simple effective device teach kid value dollar nice little bit large good saving bank educational value go far basic

Indeed it is cardboard, but a very thick, heavy type that seems extremely sturdy. We've had this bank for about 8 months and it has been great. It's withstanding the amount of use it gets (putting money in regularly and opening and closing it a couple times a month), the design looks cute in my child's room, and it is perfectly functional as a bank w/3 compartments. Obviously it's not going to last forever, but it makes an excellent ""first bank"" and the price is less than the plastic banks of similar design. Actually, considering the way technology is going, kids aren't going to walk around with piles of change the way they used to b/c everything is going electronic anyway, so I figure we'll probably end up going straight from this to a wallet.The only complaint I have about it is that after 6 mos. or so of use, the lock got stuck and we couldn't get it open with the key anymore, so we had to cut it off--but I just put one of those tiny luggage locks on it instead, which fit perfectly (you know, those ones I think the airlines don't even allow anymore, so I have a bunch of them w/matching keys that my kids love to play with).Anyway, my son thinks the lock is really fun and was also excited to have his own keychain and key that he keeps hidden in a drawer away from his little sister. ;)I love that it has the 3 compartments; this has really encouraged my child to save and give some of his funds.

I recommend ordering 2 sets so you can have doubles of every letter vs just the extra few they give you of certain letters.These magnets look great on my fridge. As far as the other reviewer's comment regarding the product not being water proof/drool proof because of the paper- I figure if and when the paper wears off it'll be a fun project for my LO & I to paint these wooden numbers with non-toxic paint. But I don't see that happening in the near future. They seem very well made and sturdy and it's very difficult to even tell there is paper on them instead of paint.  Great alternative to the ugly cheap plastic magnets that are no good for our babies nor the environment!I am very pleased and recommend this set to everyone.

The magnet goes all the way through the shape, and my son likes to &#34;stamp&#34; them on his magna doodle. This is, by the way, an activity I highly recommend. We stumbled on the observation that these numbers (and the Melissa and Doug letters) can be used to stamp the Magna Doodle, and for a while that was pretty much all my son wanted to do with his time. He is almost 3, and well ahead on reading and math, and I think that this stamping activity had something to do with his speed. I should say that the paper covering on the numbers does wear off fast, but then these numbers get a lot of use. Also there are three of each number (because the set allows you to model simple equations), so even if your kids loses numbers like mine does it takes a while before you run out. I probably bought my first box a year and a half ago, and I haven't opened the fourth box yet, so keeping my son in numbers is costing me about $50 a year.

My husband thought it might be because the Pantone pages show about 20 different variations on the color (cherry red, tomato red, burgundy red, wine red) etc. and he thought it might be better to just have ONE color to represent the concept (just cherry red for red) and that that might be the issue.  These cards looked well made and since my girls had destroyed a ""heavy cardstock"" style of flash cards before, they were the best option.  The ring is plastic, and one set (this one) the ring stays together better than the other set (the ABCs one).  A drop of super glue should fix that.  The cards are very heavy cardboard, and have a glossy sheen on them, which makes them easy to clean up (wipe off food...) and also easy for the girls to turn the cards (2.5 and 4 yr old).  The quality is high in my opinion.  the words are easy to read, and the shapes are easy to distinguish for the most part.  The bunny with the square tooth was odd in my opinion - I get it, but the square was very small.  It does help them identify the shapes in real world settings, but I was looking for something more basic than that.  My only complaint on the set is that for the colors the front side has it on the animal (for example, the blue elephant, since that's the pic you see on this page), but it is set in the solid color background (purple).  When you turn the card over, it shows you the color ""blue"" in a circle, but the background of that page isn't blue, it is purple.  So when you ask a 2.5 yr old what color that is, half the time she says purple, half the time blue.  I'd have preferred the whole back side of the card be the identifying color ""blue"".  The ironic part is that the shape cards are this way - the back is the same color inside the shape as outside it, so I may end up using those to identify colors as well as shapes, since there won't be any confusion as to which part I'm asking her to identify.

We also like the colored border which makes finding the right side to use much easier.

So we bought this one as a physical puzzle for her to practice spatial pattern recognition. The pieces are big and the puzzle picture image is well chosen for few redundant elements and enough different colored objects. The pieces are nicely divided up so each one has a distinct image that can be easily identified within the overall picture. My daughter still struggles to get all the correct pieces in place but it is easy to explain how the bit with the black and white is part of the cow, the pink is the pig and so on.

She already was a puzzle lover, but we needed to find some that were a little more challenging for her than just the 2 or 3 piece matching ones, but not overly difficult for her either.  She can't yet do this one fully one her own, but it does engage her if we sit with her and she loves the challenge and resists our help as long as possible.  She loves this and the butterfly puzzle we got her from the same brand.  We will definitely buy her the other other puzzles (sea life and dinosaurs) that I've seen here as well.The puzzle pieces are not AS durable as some of her wooden puzzles, but still plenty strong, and much better than your typical cardboard jigsaw you find.  I can't decide if I like the re-usable pouch or not.  In some ways, I like that it is less bulky than some of the wooden boxes/frames that her other puzzles come in, especially while she is doing the puzzle, but it also feels like it won't last as long (though still quite durable itself).  It seems less stack able or organized when we're putting her puzzles and toys away as well, but that's minor and not worth taking stars away from my rating in my opinion (again, I see both pros and cons, just trying to give all my thoughts here in case people are wondering).I like that she can easily put the pig together, then the cow, and then the barn, and then she kind of brings it all together after that.  It definitely is helping her think about how things work and fit together and keeps her engaged for quite a while.  Since I often appreciate getting other good/similar recommendations from other reviewers, I will say that we also got her the Melissa and Doug puzzles where they come with a box with 4 different (smaller but still 12 pieces) puzzles in each box.  Those are probably our favorites as she can do those completely on her own, the puzzles themselves take up a little less space, I like the clean organization of the boxes to keep them in, and the little wooden pieces are just a bit more durable.  That all said, I will gladly continue to buy her more of those and these puzzles for good variety as she loves puzzles and I am happy they keep her quietly occupied in a contained area for a while and learning how to think and strategize a bit too!",5.0,28-month-old daughter loves it,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,nearly review give butterfly puzzle case read read review there.)My 28 month old daughter get Christmas play puzzle regularly   puzzle lover need find little challenging 2 3 piece matching one overly difficult   fully engage sit love challenge resist help long possible   love butterfly puzzle get brand   definitely buy puzzle sea life dinosaur see puzzle piece durable wooden puzzle plenty strong well typical cardboard jigsaw find   decide like usable pouch   way like bulky wooden box frame puzzle come especially puzzle feel like will long durable   stack able organize put puzzle toy away minor worth take star away rating opinion pro con try thought case people wondering).I like easily pig cow barn kind bring   definitely help think thing work fit keep engage   appreciate get good similar recommendation reviewer get Melissa Doug puzzle come box 4 different small 12 piece puzzle box   probably favorite completely puzzle little space like clean organization box little wooden piece bit durable   say gladly continue buy puzzle good variety love puzzle happy quietly occupy contain area learn think strategize bit

She already was a puzzle lover, but we needed to find some that were a little more challenging for her than just the 2 or 3 piece matching ones, but not overly difficult for her either.She can't yet do this one fully one her own, but it does engage her if we sit with her and she loves the challenge and resists our help as long as possible.  She loves this and the MudPuppy farm puzzle she got as well.  We will definitely buy her the other other puzzles (sea life and dinosaurs) that I've seen of theirs.The puzzle pieces are not as durable as some of her wooden puzzles, but still plenty strong, and much better than your typical cardboard jigsaw you find.I can't decide if I like the re-usable pouch or not.  In some ways, I like that it is less bulky than some of the wooden boxes/frames that her other puzzles come in, especially while she is doing the puzzle, but it also feels like it won't last as long (though still quite durable itself).  It's less stack-able or seemingly less organized then when we're putting her puzzles and toys away, but that's minor and not worth taking stars away from my rating in my opinion (again, I see both pros and cons, just trying to give all my thoughts here in case people are wondering).This one is a little tougher than the farm puzzle as there are more similar colors and it's all butterflies/insects vs. the variety of the cow, pig, barn in the farm puzzle so she definitely struggles a bit more with this one and is more likely to ask for help or give up, but I think she'll be doing it on her own in the next few months.  They definitely help her think about how things work and fit together and keep her engaged for quite a while.Since I often appreciate getting other good/similar recommendations from other reviewers, I will say that we also got her the Melissa and Doug puzzles where they come with a box with 4 different (smaller but still 12 pieces) puzzles in each box.  Those are probably our favorites as she can do those completely on her own, the puzzles themselves take up a little less space, I like the clean organization of the boxes to keep them in, and the little wooden pieces are just a bit more durable.  That all said, I will gladly continue to buy her more of those and these puzzles for good variety as she loves puzzles and I am happy they keep her quietly occupied in a contained area for a while and learning how to think and strategize a bit too!",5.0,My 28-mth-old loves it,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,nearly review give similar farm puzzle case read read review there.)My 28 month old daughter get Christmas play puzzle regularly   puzzle lover need find little challenging 2 3 piece matching one overly difficult fully engage sit love challenge resist help long possible   love MudPuppy farm puzzle get   definitely buy puzzle sea life dinosaur see theirs puzzle piece durable wooden puzzle plenty strong well typical cardboard jigsaw find decide like usable pouch   way like bulky wooden box frame puzzle come especially puzzle feel like will long durable   stack able seemingly organized put puzzle toy away minor worth take star away rating opinion pro con try thought case people wondering).this little tough farm puzzle similar color butterfly insect vs. variety cow pig barn farm puzzle definitely struggle bit likely ask help think month   definitely help think thing work fit engage appreciate get good similar recommendation reviewer get Melissa Doug puzzle come box 4 different small 12 piece puzzle box   probably favorite completely puzzle little space like clean organization box little wooden piece bit durable   say gladly continue buy puzzle good variety love puzzle happy quietly occupy contain area learn think strategize bit

The production values are rather low and the rules horribly written.  If you take the time to really, really sift through the rules you can enjoy this game.The neat thing is that the game comes in many forms.  You can play it solitaire.  Your goal is to clean up crime in Sanctuary.  Or you can play the basic design for two to five players or an advanced version of the same game.  Finally, you can try a six player version (just so you don't leave anyone out.  I found the advanced game the most satisfying.You goal is to commit thefts so that you gain and secure 300 silver pieces.  Along the way you may luck into 10 or 20 silver pieces here or there.  Of course you will lose money as you get thrown in the dungeon, mugged by other players, have bad luck, or choose to buy weapons, thugs, or magic to assist you.In a neat convention, players move their characters and the guards during their turn.  Two six sided dice and one ten sided die are rolled and the player uses two to move his/her character with the remaining die used to move the guard.  In this way players can choose to move the guards away from them, toward their competiton, or hopefully both.  After moving to the designated area players burgle, mug, or pick pocket their way to wealth and retirement.  Fortune smiles on the players in the liberal mecca of Sanctuary as even the worst of thefts results in only a temporary setback - no death or dismemberment here.Overall this is a decent game, but it will take you awhile to find this out.

The drugs are all impressive looking fantasy heroes, and the microbes are all scary demons, but the form, setting, weaponry, etc. that each takes is almost entirely arbitrary, which can be confusing and is a huge missed opportunity to make learning easier.For example, Ciprofloxacin and Levofloaxcin are two related drugs that have some subtle but important differences. But from the way that they're depicted on the cards, you'd never guess they had anything to do with each other. Levo is a man wearing green armor standing in a green wooden background carrying a spear with blades on the end. Cipro is a woman in a blue and pink dress carrying a short dagger on a largely white and pink background. In fact, Cipro ends up looking at lot like Metronidazole, Ampicillin, and Tetracycline, which creates a clear visual linkage between 4 drugs that really couldn't be more different.You might also think that Imipenem/cilastin, an extremely broad-spectrum combination therapy that is described as ""Elite warriors!"" on the card, might look particularly imposing. But no, they look just like all the others. The microbes are only a little better. F. tularensis looks like a rabbit, but why antrhax is a dragon surrounded by firey butterflies, I have no idea. You also might think they'd make the gram positive bugs have purple themed cards and the negatives red, but no, it's often the opposite, which again creates confusing visual associations that I'd have had to consciously reverse.The list goes on and on.

I feel abused after playing it. the abuse was both mental and physical. I would go so far as to call it torture. I was the victim of a lot of Kickstarter hype and got suckered into buying it. Never again.Tammany hall is an area control Game. The very attractive board is a map of old NY with all the wards in various shades of earth tones. Each of up to 5 players has a pile of ""Bosses"" that they place in wards each turn to influence the immegrant community to vote for them in an election. There are 4 different Imigrant groups: German, English, Irish and Italian. All the groups except the Italians are on the board at set up. All are randomly placed except the Irish are in Tammany Hall. Game turns are seperated into 4 Terms of 4 years each. Each turn You choose to place two Bosses in wards of your choice or a Boss and one immegrant cube from a group randomly chosen from a bag and placed in on the board representing those straight off the boat. The cube comes with a political favor chip of the same color that you will use to vote during the election phase that comes at the end of each 4 year term. The object of the game is to win elections and dominate the most wards in order to get victory points and more political favor chips by having the most of any immigrant group in your Wards. Elections take place in a ward order marked by arrows on the board. If a ward is contested the players with bosses in that ward engage in a blind ballot using the political favor chips they have accumulated as votes. (Note: there is NO auction or bidding in the game as stated in the Amazon discription) they can only use the color that is represented by the immigrants present in the ward at the time of the election. The winner gets the ward for scoring and all other bosses are removed from that ward. The person who wins the most wards after an election gets to be the Mayor who then gets to assign city jobs to the rest of the players that give them certain powers that affect the game. For example; the police chief can arrest any immirgrant anywhere once per year. Then there is the power to slander. players get 3 slander chips that they can use to remove other bosses in the course of the game at the rate of 1 per term.All of this probably sounds pretty cool and to be honest the Theme kind of works through its abstraction. But it's a vicious, nasty game where you are forced into backstabbing conflict. Now normally I would love that but the problem is that the game has no balance at all. One or two bad first moves in the game will sentence a player to 90 minutes of frustrating tedium with no hope of recovery because the game doesn't give you a mechanism to recover. If you can't win wards you can't get favor chips by having the most immigrants and without favor chips you have no votes. Because territory is tight you are forced into conflicts you can't win for no good reason because your options when you are behind become so limited. You have to play your bosses somewhere. The word used most by my game group on breaking out this game was ""tedious"". It took way to long to play for what it is.I feel I should mention the quality and price as well. The art is nice though nothing that might require an art department and the board and box are of exceptional quality. I would go so far to say that it is overkill but The parts themselves seem pretty standard off the shelf chips and meeples though the meeples might be custom. The bottom line is you could get any map of anywhere and apply a similar theme ( maybe the Mafia in Sicily ) and buy a few components from a game store or use components from another game and create your own better game using the same mechanics.

This book adds yet another view on the Romulans  inconsistent with two most prevalent ones already out there, making it  impossible to reconcile the three.LUG's Romulan Core Setting breaks down  into three books.  The first one goes into mind set, government, ships,  ranks, etc... The basis on what you need to run a Romulan Campaign.  Then  their is a book on how to make a Romulan character and finally an adventure  manual.Though most Romulan devotees will find yet another view  irritating, the books do provide an coherent setting and background.  The  layout is fairly well done and there is a fairly good table of contents and  good handouts.The overall quality of work in this book is poor to fair.  If you expect good graphics and pictures you will be disapointed.  The  drawings for the most part appear to have been done by a 5 year old and add  nothing to the narratives when they appear.  Where an image could have  aided the narratives there are none.An example in the book is when it  speaks of the alien race the Romulans fought with during their 30 year  silence, as mentioned in the Series.  The book goes into alien mindset,  technology and appearance.  Yet when you look for an image of these beings  you are treated to a thick line drawing a 3rd grader might have  drawn.For the price I would have hoped that they would have gotten  someone who could have illustrated this professionally, brought the other  two authorized views in conjunction with this one and added color, maybe  photos to it.",2.0,A core setting view for Star Trek RPG on the Romulans,933033600,"07 27, 1999",Toys_and_Games,0,devoted fan Romulans Star trek look FASA installment Romulans Diane Duane LUG   book add view Romulans   inconsistent prevalent one make   impossible reconcile LUG Romulan Core set break   book   go mind set government ship   rank etc basis need run Romulan Campaign     book Romulan character finally adventure   manual Romulan devotee find view   irritate book provide coherent setting background     layout fairly fairly good table content   good handout overall quality work book poor fair   expect good graphic picture disapointe     drawing appear 5 year old add   narrative appear   image   aid narrative example book   speak alien race Romulans fight 30 year   silence mention Series   book go alien mindset   technology appearance   look image being   treat thick line draw 3rd grader   draw price hope get   illustrate professionally bring   authorize view conjunction add color maybe   photo

When you pick up the pieces, many times there are no way to tell what you are holding, so you have to go by the shape rather than the picture to put it together.  Eg. one piece has just a colorful dot - with just this information, you cannot visually look for the next piece since it is not a continuation of a picture. You either have to consult the picture on the box to see which dot comes next, or try out each piece until you happen to come across the shape that fits the piece (which is my daughter's method).Similarly, the body part of the caterpillar is cut in such a way that you are looking at a green puzzle piece that all looks similar except for the different cut. No way to tell whether you are holding the caterpillar's neck, back, tail or the belly. So the way to complete this puzzle is mainly to work from the corner/side and find the pieces that fit each other by shapes.  While my daughter can complete the puzzle, this is not my (nor my daughter's) favorite.

There are other games that are more fun.  Under $40? Maybe.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Full Review:Castle Ravenloft: A D&D; BoardgameMy friends and I bought Castle Ravenloft mainly for the fact that it is a cooperative game where all players work towards an end goal together.  While this is true, the fun factor of the game just isnt there and I will explain why:First, how the game works.  The game comes with about 30 or so ""tiles"" which are cardboard puzzle pieces about 5x5 inches long.  Each of these tiles has a diagram of a hallway, room, or corridor and a grid of squares that is used to measure the movement of your character when exploring.  In this way as you explore you draw from the puzzle pile and attach it to the area you are headed into revealing a new area with new challenges.  So far so good.The game also comes with an adventure guide that describes what you are supposed to be doing while exploring.  It also has you set up the puzzle pile in certain ways so that the event room that holds the quest is placed ""after the 8th draw"" for example.  Additionally it has other factors, some adventures are timed reflecting the sun setting, some have mini boss monsters harass the players, ect. ect.  In this way each time you play there will be some variation.  The adventure guide has some 15 or so different adventures and you are free to create your own.  Still so far so good.Before you start, you choose a character from one of the five available.  Wizard, warrior, rogue, cleric, and ranger.  Then you select powers from each of their individual decks (which is only approx 8 cards each).  You dont get all the powers, you must select which ones you want therefore further making each game different.  There is also a treasure deck and each player starts with one draw from it.  Most treasure cards are expendable one time use items such as a potion of healing or a blessing that lets you use one of your other one-time use powers again.  As you explore each monster that you kill gives you another draw from the treasure deck, as well as an experience point value based on the monster.  By this point we were very excited to play and had high hopes.All of the pieces, markers, and cards were of good quality as can be expected from a wizards of the coast product.  My friends and I are not fans of the style of the art, but do recognize its quality.  We chose an adventure and rolled to see who went first and got underway...Unfortunately from here on out, the game fell terribly short of our hopes that it would be good.  For starters, each time a player explores a new area, a monster card and sometimes an encounter card is drawn.  The games phases state that once you explore a new area you can no longer move or do anything with your character.  This means that the monster(s) that were drawn will always attack first.  This takes strategy out of exploring as the result will always be the same.  Next, if a character does not explore a new area he or she must then draw from the encounter deck and 90% of those cards are detrimental like ""each player on the tile takes 1 damage"" or ""choose a power, you can no longer use that power this adventure"".  Encounter cards are like anti-treasure cards, negative things that happen.  I dont like that each character that doesnt explore a new area must draw an encounter card because sometimes if you are fighting monsters, you dont want to explore a new area thus revealing more that you will have to deal with and that will attack before you can react.Eventually the monsters and encounter cards just grind the players down to 0 hit points where they must use one of their 2 healing surges to revive themselves.  If they have no healing surges left, the game ends in a loss.  There is no way to prevent the grind.  There doesnt seem to be any epic successes or failures for either the players or monsters.  The powers mostly just let you hit things further away from you or hit every monster on a tile, ect.  There just isnt enough variation of things to do on your turn.  Its always like ""I use magic missile."" over and over.  Moving even seems pointless since the only factor is whether you explore a new area or not thus having to draw from the encounter deck.As you gather xp you can spend it to either level up or to cancel an encounter card drawn for 5 points each.  You can only level up once.  After that there is no character progression aside from treasure which is mostly lackluster from what we saw.In conclusion, we tried the game 2 times after that first time.  Each adventure was different granted, but the constant grind was always the same.  The game has potential!  But in my opinion you must come up with some house rules to make it more strategic and fun.  I suggest:-when a new monster card is drawn by exploring a new tile roll randomly to see on which players turn the monster acts instead of it always being the explorer's turn-let players explore new areas on their movement phase so that they can still do something after they explore-double the hit points of all non-boss monsters to compensate for the above 2 items-dont force players to draw an encounter card if they attack a monster on their turn and do not explore a new areaRecommended:No",2.0,"Potential, but as is lacking...",1296950400,"02 6, 2011",Toys_and_Games,0,potential need house rule write Feb 05 11product rating 2 5 starspros -quality piece varied quest cooperativecon strategy tactical repetative combat annoying encountersthe line game potential worth   game fun   $ 40 Maybe.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Full review Castle Ravenloft d&d BoardgameMy friend buy Castle Ravenloft mainly fact cooperative game player work end goal   true fun factor game not explain game work   game come 30 tile cardboard puzzle piece 5x5 inch long   tile diagram hallway room corridor grid square measure movement character explore   way explore draw puzzle pile attach area head reveal new area new challenge   far good game come adventure guide describe suppose explore   set puzzle pile certain way event room hold quest place 8th draw example   additionally factor adventure time reflect sun setting mini boss monster harass player ect ect   way time play variation   adventure guide 15 different adventure free create   far good start choose character available   Wizard warrior rogue cleric ranger   select power individual deck approx 8 card   not power select one want make game different   treasure deck player start draw   treasure card expendable time use item potion healing blessing let use time use power   explore monster kill give draw treasure deck experience point value base monster   point excited play high hope piece marker card good quality expect wizard coast product   friend fan style art recognize quality   choose adventure roll go get underway unfortunately game fall terribly short hope good   starter time player explore new area monster card encounter card draw   game phase state explore new area long character   mean monster(s draw attack   take strategy explore result   character explore new area draw encounter deck 90 card detrimental like player tile take 1 damage choose power long use power adventure   Encounter card like anti treasure card negative thing happen   not like character not explore new area draw encounter card fight monster not want explore new area reveal deal attack react eventually monster encounter card grind player 0 hit point use 2 healing surge revive   healing surge leave game end loss   way prevent grind   not epic success failure player monster   power let hit thing away hit monster tile ect   not variation thing turn   like use magic missile   move pointless factor explore new area have draw encounter deck gather xp spend level cancel encounter card draw 5 point   level   character progression aside treasure lackluster see conclusion try game 2 time time   adventure different grant constant grind   game potential   opinion come house rule strategic fun   suggest:-when new monster card draw explore new tile roll randomly player turn monster act instead explorer turn let player explore new area movement phase explore double hit point non boss monster compensate 2 item dont force player draw encounter card attack monster turn explore new arearecommended

Sadly, I found this game to be severely lacking.The way the game is structured, you have a scenario with a win condition known at the start of the game (the sessions I played were an escort mission, and a quest to kill a dracolich). Players then take turns moving and exploring, with player turns working much like D&D; turns. The exploration system is my primary problem with the game. You go to the edge of the board, and lay down a random tile. Every tile has a monster, and every monster immediately attacks the character. There is no opportunity for reaction, tactics, etc. There are several reasons why this is problematic.D&D; characters have strengths and weaknesses. Take, for example, the wizard. A wizard's strength is being able to attacks enemies from afar, often multiple ones. Their weakness is typically lack of ability to take damage, represented by a low hit point total. Castle Ravenloft's Exploration/Encounter system heavily penalizes the wizard character for having fewer hit points than the other characters. We came to realize that this character was just not viable for playing.Another weakness is the Exploration/Encounter system, as I mentioned before. Every exploration reveals an enemy. And while it is nice that all players cooperate, the tactics they use largely make them feel the same.Another game that occupies this same conceptual space is Descent. Also a dungeon crawl game, Descent has one player operate as the Overlord, controlling the monsters. Its gameplay is smoother and more satisfying, but it does not play so quickly. A better horror exploration game that plays in a similar amount of time is Betrayal at House on the Hill (mentioned earlier). Primarily cooperative, it uses a traitor mechanic that causes one player to unexpectedly betray the party, which sets into motion a story-driven scenario, where both the traitor and the rest of the players have distinct win conditions.To sum up, this is not a good game. There are planty of other good cooperative games to measure this against. The poorly-conceived systems diminish its playability, and its small number of scenarios limit its replayability.

{'$oid': '5a13282b741a2384e879b011'},A2BNCLU2O8Q4SP,0786955708,Jonathan Mayer,"[36, 46]","Here is my review, cross-posted from boardgamegeek.com:I have fond memories of D&D; from my youth, that I occasionally attempt to recapture. I remember the sense of vague foreboding conjured by RPG-like board games such as Runequest and Spacehulk. I had read some favorable reviews of the new ""RPG-as-boardgame"" series promoted by Wizards on the Coast, and I was excited to try this. I splunked down my hard-earned cash and amazon duly delivered a hefty box of dreams to my doorstep.Wrath of Ashardalon and I had some good times initially. My friends and I gamely punched all the cardboard pieces out of the sprues. We love punching pieces out of sprues! It inspires a sense of childlike wonder and anticipation in us! This tile has a Horrid Chamber on it! That dungeon tile has dead bodies! Ooh, I wonder what a flaming sphere does? These cards all have various powers and spells on them! Look, you can play a dragon character! And the plastic figurines were enjoyable, similar to those plastic dinosaurs we all had as kids. Whee!Sadly, that was the best part of the game. Everything went downhill when we actually started to play.The game itself is a reductionist vision of a dungeon crawl. It is, unfortunately, so reductionist that is effectively a game of Munchkin, but without a sense of humor. I think the game designers must have sensed this, and to try to add a sense of danger and urgency to the game, they created a deck of sadistic Encounter cards to punish us for playing. (But more about those later.)The players progress through the dungeon together. At every unexplored edge, they ""kick down the door"" and grow the dungeon by one (1) new dungeon tile, guaranteed to contain exactly one (1) new monster, and possible an Encounter card (which is invariably unpleasant). This game might have been interesting if every new corner of the dungeon had produced a novel challenge for the players to make strategic decisions about together. Instead, the players typically have one power which is the min-max best option for any given monster, and they use it, over and over again. The twenty-sided die is rolled. The monster advances. It does a hit point of damage to the wizard! And then it dies. And drops a treasure.It's difficult to be heroic in this game. The characters are punished for pushing forward into the darkness. They are also punished for standing still. They are punished for gathering together on one tile, and they are punished for spreading out. There are precious few strategic decisions to be made in this game.All of this is incredibly tedious and dull. I magic missile the darkness.The power cards feel poorly thought out, poorly worded, and disappointing. The ""Hypnosis"" card, seems promising: it can cause one monster to attack another! My goodness, a card that allows the players to turn the dungeon against itself! Strategy! But no. Unlike the Scroll of Monster Control item, which replaces a monster's attack on the players, Hypnosis simply supplements the monster's action with it's ""hypnotized"" attack. But can the power at least let the players turn the Cave Bear's awesome Claws attack against the Kobold horde? No, not really. The monster's attack is reduced to a standardized ""Attack +9, Damage 1,"" as printed on the card. Really, this card is a +9, 1 damage attack that only works if two monsters are in the same room. Is this what the game designers intended? Who knows! But hey, that's what it says on the card.If the player's powers are boring, at least the game designers also gave us Encounter cards. We scrubbed through the rules multiple times, certain we were misinterpreting them. But no: every player will typically draw at least one encounter card every turn. Thus, a four-player band of characters fighting a monster will typically draw four encounter cards every round of combat. Sadly, the encounter cards aren't terribly creative. They all seem to be variants of ""Random thing happens! And everybody takes a point of damage."" Your band of fearless heroes has just spent a turn vanquishing a kobold, and you're feeling pretty good about it. But wait, you turn isn't over until you draw an Encounter card. Oops! The room you're in just turned into a pit! Most of the players fall into it. You do the heroic thing and stay in the room with the pit to help your friends climb out. But lo, on the next turn the pit rolls to attack again and sucks you in!Many of the encounter traps seem more malevolent that is actually necessary. The spinning ball of blade trap will follow you from room to room. The walls turn to magma! But on the next turn the magma reverts to stone while an alarm sounds, alerting the orcish horde to our presence! A cage falls on your head! Poisonous gas fills the room! It's so zany! The Encounter cards prove to be far more lethal than any monster encountered in the dungeon. The players will come to dread having to take their turn.We were certain that we missed some part of the game on our first run-through. Maybe we were playing it wrong. Maybe we had misinterpreted the rules. So we played it through a second time, and lo: the game as written is truly terrible. At least, we knew that with a few rule changes, we could fix this game. Instead of making the monsters and traps follow unrealistic instructions printed on cards, we decided it would be better to designate one of our number of administrate all the monsters. And, instead of using the limited characters provided with the game (and, no doubt, soon-to-be-available expansion packs), we would create our own characters ourselves. And, instead of plastic figurines and delightful cardboard squares, we would use our imaginations.The game is much more fun that way.",2.0,a disappointing co-op game,1305504000,"05 16, 2011",Toys_and_Games,0,review cros post boardgamegeek.com fond memory D&D youth occasionally attempt recapture remember sense vague foreboding conjure rpg like board game Runequest Spacehulk read favorable review new rpg boardgame series promote Wizards Coast excited try splunke hard earn cash amazon duly deliver hefty box dream doorstep Wrath Ashardalon good time initially friend gamely punch cardboard piece sprue love punch piece sprue inspire sense childlike wonder anticipation tile Horrid Chamber dungeon tile dead body ooh wonder flame sphere card power spell look play dragon character plastic figurine enjoyable similar plastic dinosaur kid whee!sadly good game go downhill actually start play game reductionist vision dungeon crawl unfortunately reductionist effectively game Munchkin sense humor think game designer sense try add sense danger urgency game create deck sadistic Encounter card punish playing later.)the player progress dungeon unexplored edge kick door grow dungeon 1 new dungeon tile guarantee contain exactly 1 new monster possible Encounter card invariably unpleasant game interesting new corner dungeon produce novel challenge player strategic decision instead player typically power min max good option give monster use sided die roll monster advance hit point damage wizard die drop treasure difficult heroic game character punish push forward darkness punish stand punish gather tile punish spread precious strategic decision game incredibly tedious dull magic missile darkness power card feel poorly think poorly word disappointing hypnosis card promise cause monster attack goodness card allow player turn dungeon strategy unlike Scroll Monster Control item replace monster attack player hypnosis simply supplement monster action hypnotize attack power let player turn Cave Bear awesome Claws attack Kobold horde monster attack reduce standardized attack +9 damage 1 print card card +9 1 damage attack work monster room game designer intend know hey say card player power boring game designer give Encounter card scrub rule multiple time certain misinterpret player typically draw encounter card turn player band character fight monster typically draw encounter card round combat sadly encounter card terribly creative variant random thing happen everybody take point damage band fearless hero spend turn vanquish kobold feel pretty good wait turn draw Encounter card oops room turn pit player fall heroic thing stay room pit help friend climb lo turn pit roll attack suck in!many encounter trap malevolent actually necessary spin ball blade trap follow room room wall turn magma turn magma revert stone alarm sound alert orcish horde presence cage fall head poisonous gas fill room zany Encounter card prove far lethal monster encounter dungeon player come dread have turn certain miss game run maybe play wrong maybe misinterpret rule play second time lo game write truly terrible know rule change fix game instead make monster trap follow unrealistic instruction print card decide well designate number administrate monster instead limited character provide game doubt soon available expansion pack create character instead plastic figurine delightful cardboard square use imagination game fun way

{'$oid': '5a13282b741a2384e879b027'},A1AJWJGB89GSIL,0786955708,R. Huffman,"[4, 5]","I have a wife and kids & I don't have time to be apart of a gaming group, thus I really don't play D&D; type games. I also live in a rural area where finding people to game with is difficult, especially for people who like something more than party games. Furthermore, I have been really tired of video games and wanted to play some board games as a break from all that.I stopped playing D&D; when I was a teenager, because some idiot would ultimately become the strongest player/character thus intimidating other players and then turning on everyone either killing them, or making them his slave during game play. I eventually quit because I was so unhappy with these confrontations. No matter who the group was, these negative effects seem to occur.Recently I have been quite interested in the new D&D; board games that have been produced by ""Wizards of the Coast"". After watching many reviews on youtube, I decided to take a leap and buy ""The Wrath of Ashardalon"". I like the idea there is no dungeon master and you could play this solo.Box Opening/First Impressions:My first impressions upon opening the box was that of a kid at Christmas, with lots of beautiful pieces. Dungeon tiles, to amazing artwork on the cards, very nice looking rule book, etc etc. The figures could be used for your regular D&D; games and are high quality for plastic models.All the components are sturdy and well made which should stand up over time.Game Play:I have played many scenarios and I would prefer a bit more narrative. They give you the overall game feel about a village needing help from a dragon and then there is a few sentences about the scenario you have chosen, but not much more.However, I am a bit disappointed. ""TWoA"" seemed rather simplistic; draw a monster card, move, kill, deal with a ""encounter trap"", rinse and repeat. You don't really gain much XP, treasure or much for killing monsters, traps or any other deed. I have heard this game was BASED upon the 4th Ed. D&D; rules. Much of the game play was simplified as well. I guess this is my concern and I have tried to remedy this with some alterations.Playing games like World of Warcraft and Skyrim has made my idea of what a fantasy gaming should be? Because in many video games there is much more to do to keep you vested.I know I can hear some people say, that there are other scenarios like ""rescuing villagers"", but really the different scenarios are much the same. I have heard you can use other pieces and elements from the other D&D; board games.... but... I just wish there was more depth here.I have been altering the game to make it more flavorful and interesting like making more Encounter cards. I have taken the 3 good cards in that deck and made more of them (treasure, healing potion). Thus making the characters deal with more than just being attacked at every corner. I also have bought real metal coins for treasure so the ""clinking"" sound of loot makes it more fun. I plan more altering in the future to keep the game fresh and fun.In Summary:As Tom Vasel (from the Dice Tower) said in one of his game reviews, ""people often don't like games due to their preconceived ideas they have or what they wish a game would be""... and I would generally agree with that.

This game markets itself for 2-4 players, but anything less than four players will force you to use rules that tried to find a way to make it work. Two players and four players are the real options, 3 players won't work so well as the rules for doing so can be a strain.Pros:1. This game incorporates the use of points so that the game doesn't drag out like risk can.2. This game has different units that move differently and have different rules to how they work.3. Dungeons offer the feel like you're fighting for treasure, even though the actual dungeon system is lame.4. Event cards offer flavor to the factions on the map.5. Tactics have a strong role in this board game.Cons:1. Different units move at different speeds and you can lose track of how much they can move, in addition to costing differently so you always need the reference sheet on hand in addition to different attack dice for different unit types. Movement also has additional rules attached, that while they feel realistic (dragons can fly over enemy territory without engaging but must land on friendly soil), can be a pain to remember (for instance, landing on enemy land that has no units AFTER a combat round is impossible as it would start combat and you can't do that once combat is over hence even though the land is empty, you can't land there).2. The dungeon system is REALLY lame, you pull at random a 'creature', which has very little development to it that you can actually simplify a description of said creature as 'strong/weak' and that's it. No real flavor to the point that it feels like the whole dungeon system was unnecessary.3. Only two hero units (hero units are the only ones able to fight in dungeons), with wizard easily outclassing the fighter because of the overpowered system of 'first strike', meaning before you check to see if the enemy has harmed/killed your troops, you check to see if you had enough successes with first strike to have gone ahead and won the battle. The fighter's SLIGHTLY cheaper cost does not offset this advantage.4. Overly complicated battle rules, especially for naval battles. First, only hero units can attack at sea while on a boat, second, elemental units do two times the damage at sea, third, sticking units on a boat spends one movement point for a boat, four, both armies roll attack at the same time and damage occurs at the same time meaning both can wipe each other out (never encountered this concept before, and remembering it amidst the many other rules is a pain), five, siege engines that are ATTACKING do more damage than siege engines that are defending (no wait, I meant POTENTIALLY, they roll two attacks and even though logic dictates that either both hit or both fail, it's somehow possible to miss on one, it's one of those rules that are more for mechanics than to actually make sense), six, building a castle confers no benefits to units, only to act as a point to drop off reinforcements, seven, some units can move again after a battle. There are other complicated battle rules but I'll stop here.5. Event cards offer the ONLY flavor to the factions on the map. The different factions have no real defining trait except for event cards, and most event cards are extremely similar. Would have been better to either work harder on defining the different factions or simply make them all the same.Truth be told? For what it achieves, I'd rather get risk. I don't know how I sound saying that, but just try to understand when I say 'for what it achieves'. If this game could feel more unique to its take on war games, then I'd prefer it to risk.

Salvatore was releasing the first Drizzt books at around the same time, so I picked the series up and have read every one of the novels.  For the most part they're great and I would highly recommend them.  This game has a lot of recognizable names, which is nice for everyone like myself who has read the books.  However, I did not find the game to be much fun at all.  Here's why:1) There is no role-playing.  The game is purely hack-and-slash, which is not what I look for in D&D.;  It could have been ok, however...2) The rules are over-restrictive (and simplified from full-on D&D;) and get in the way of enjoyment.  This game still has tons of rules, but they're taking components of D&D; (which is far more complex) and smashing them into a single-purpose board game.  This means that you still have to spend a lot of time learning fairly inconsequential rules that are essential to the functioning of the game.3) There is only a single, workable strategy if you want to win: run...fast.  Because of the way the game is designed, your characters are punished for not moving at an extremely rapid pace toward the objective.  It makes the game difficult to enjoy because I spend all my time strategizing how to avoid drawing Encounter cards (which you'll become familiar with if you play the game).  The rest of the decisions you need to make in the game are extremely straightforward and simple.  Some characters only have one reusable attack option.Some of my friends who had never played a real RPG before had a good time with this game.  We later played a real D&D; session, which they liked more.  In my opinion, this is a 2.5 star game (I bumped it to 3 because I'm a Drizzt fan and less RPG-experienced people liked it more).  I don't care to play it again, but that's because I know there's much better stuff out there.  The game appealed more to people used to playing board games rather than RPGs.

Lets take a look.COMPONENTSThe board is completely functional.  Your player markers are completely functional.  The cards are OK.  Some of the text on them is a bit small and difficult for people not right next to them to read.  Money is cardboard chits and are a bit weird, but once you get used to which shape/size is what value, it's good enough.  Everything else?  Cubes.  Warriors?  Cubes.  Wizards?  Cubes.GAMEPLAYYou take turns placing your workers which let you take quests or resources to complete those quests and/or draw/play cards, and then if you can/want to, you then spend resources to complete one of your quests.  Completing a quest gives you points and many times, more resources to spend later.  Additionally, you can take an action to &#34;buy&#34; a new action space to be put on the board (which you can take or, if anyone else takes it, you get a kickback for owning it).Additionally, there are some hidden bonuses for completing certain types of quests (each player has different hidden goals).  What it really ends up meaning is, if you're lucky and can get goals which don't have a lot of competition (so others aren't taking your quests) and are lucky enough for your type of quests to show up as being available, you get a few extra points.  It's generally not game-altering.All in all, the gameplay is very solid.  My only problem with the gameplay is the cards.  Far too many of them are very &#34;take that&#34; play against one other player.  So if you're in the lead, get ready to get &#34;blue shelled&#34; quite a bit.  As a lighter game, that's not the worst thing in the world.THEMEThe theme is recruiting a small army to go on quests and do cool things, which will look familiar to those familiar to the D&D; lore.  In reality, the game always seems to come down to people paying attention to nothing but colors of cubes to collect and colors of cubes on the cards.  If the cubes were meeples of what they were representing, it would be much easier to feel the theme.  If the different types of quests actually felt different, that would help as well.  As is, it just feels like collecting resources to complete your shopping list.  The theme is a major letdown.CONCLUSIONIf you look at the reviews on Amazon for this game, you'll see literally nothing below 3 stars.  And you know why that is?  It's impossible to hate this game.  Unfortunately, if you know the better options for this type of game, you'll realize it's not easy to love, either.  The mechanics are mostly sound, but there's nothing that stands out anywhere.  The theme isn't there.  And there's better options for simpler worker placement games (The Manhattan Project, Alien Frontiers) to use to teach newer board gamers.

Tresca ""Talien""","[20, 33]","Waterdeep is probably only marginally familiar to most Dungeons & Dragons players, and only those who play in the Forgotten Realms.  Unlike the other, wilder parts of the Forgotten Realms like Neverwinter, Waterdeep is a much more stable city, which means it has much more possibilities for political intrigue. Wizards of the Coast decided to take the D&D; brand in a different direction by creating a ""Euro-style"" game in which the pen is mightier than the sword.Players take the role of powerful lords vying for control of Waterdeep, leveraging its treasures and resources to gain an advantage.  The Lords influence the city through agents, who in turn recruit adventurers.Waterdeep's presentation is gorgeous.  There are a variety of wooden meeples (agents), blocks (adventurers), four different kinds of cards, and thick card stock representing buildings, gold coins, and victory points.  Players take on one of five different organizations in the form of play mats, which assigns each player a color.Game play consists of creating buildings, sending agents, recruiting adventurers, and then sending said adventurers (different colors help differentiate their classes) on quests. The cards complicate these goals, concluding after eight rounds of play.I have nothing against this style of play, but I'm not entirely sure what it has to do with Dungeons & Dragons.  The branding from 4th Edition is nowhere in evidence.  The adventurers are just wooden blocks instead of plastic miniatures.  You don't actually roll any dice.  And last I heard, no one was clamoring for the intrigues of Waterdeep.There's nothing wrong with Lords of Waterdeep, it's just a surprising departure of the D&D; brand in a direction that's going after the adult boardgamer - use of the word ""Euro-style"" is a phrase aimed specifically at them - but it's a category I don't fit into. Euro-style games usually involve players negotiating with each other, but there's little of that in evidence here - it's more a resource game than a dialogue.That said, Lords of Waterdeep does resource strategy very well. At eight rounds it's all over quickly and players will need to maximize their every resource to win in such a short period of time. Waterdeep seems to be more of a gateway game for board gamers to become more interested in the D&D; brand than the other way around.There's one thing that will appeal to gamers of the Forgotten Realms however: the coins make an excellent prop!",3.0,For board game fans,1334793600,"04 19, 2012",Toys_and_Games,0,Waterdeep probably marginally familiar Dungeons Dragons player play Forgotten Realms   unlike wilder part Forgotten Realms like Neverwinter Waterdeep stable city mean possibility political intrigue Wizards Coast decide d&d brand different direction create euro style game pen mighty sword player role powerful lord vie control Waterdeep leverage treasure resource gain advantage   Lords influence city agent turn recruit adventurer Waterdeep presentation gorgeous   variety wooden meeple agent block adventurer different kind card thick card stock represent building gold coin victory point   player different organization form play mat assign player color game play consist create building send agent recruit adventurer send say adventurer different color help differentiate class quest card complicate goal conclude round play style play entirely sure Dungeons Dragons   branding 4th Edition evidence   adventurer wooden block instead plastic miniature   actually roll dice   hear clamor intrigue Waterdeep wrong Lords Waterdeep surprising departure D&D brand direction go adult boardgamer use word euro style phrase aim specifically category fit euro style game usually involve player negotiate little evidence resource game dialogue say Lords Waterdeep resource strategy round quickly player need maximize resource win short period time Waterdeep gateway game board gamer interested d&d brand way thing appeal gamer Forgotten Realms coin excellent prop

If you're looking at buying this you probably already knew that.  It's fairly easy to teach and learn and it plays fast.  It's also pretty good across the spectrum of players.LoW's theme rests almost entirely on the flavor text on the cards.  I've never been a D&D; player, but I've been told that D&D; players really like the flavor text on the cards, that it helps immerse them in the game.  This is exactly why I'm giving the game three stars despite all the positives.This game, if you ignore the flavor text, has almost zero theme.  It's pushing cubes around, collecting, redeeming them for points, rinse, repeat.  Now, lots of Euros have this.  I happen to enjoy many of those games.  The problem here is that LoW is specifically trying to sell a theme and, for me and at least some other players, it does not deliver.The cubes in this game are supposed represent people.  This is the crux of why I don't buy the mechanic=theme one iota.  In Stone Age, for example, you send a ""worker"" out to collect things such as food, stone, wood or gold.  Makes total sense to me.  And I don't even think Stone Age is even that thematic when put up against Ameritrash games.  In LoW you are ""recruiting"" cubes . . . um, I mean ""wizards"" or something like that . . . to fulfill tasks.  So the ""workers"" in LoW are recruiters.  Sorry, doesn't work for me.I won the very first game of LoW game I played.  I knew exactly why I won - I used an Intrigue card as one of my last plays to cripple the leader while at the same time had enough resources to jump forward (from fourth place no less) well ahead of everyone else.  Loved playing it.  But I could say the same thing about ANY of my favorite Euro board games.  Which brings me to the only thing I truly love about this game: the take that/screwage Intrique cards.  Other than that, this game is just about like any other game.LoW is a game I enjoy playing and would probably never turn down a game.  It is, however, bland.  I'm not alone in having this opinion.  If you're not a D&D; fan and/or you prefer games to have more theme than flavor text then you might feel the same.It's clear many people love this game and I understand why.  One of the major selling points for LoW is that it plays fairly quickly for its genre.  This can be a major selling point for a family or game group.  This is one reason I don't feel I need to own this game - someone else can own it and bring it to game night.Know what kind of player you are.  LoW might be a great game for you.  It is not for me.  I haven't played it yet, but I'm looking at picking up the Manhattan Project which also has screwage and, allegedly, theme.  We'll see.Edit:I see that my review is getting most negs.  With that in mind:There is a flaw here that game fans should be able to accept and not neg this review.  In most worker placement games your workers actually do something - they collect, buy, etc.  The ""recruitment"" mechanism in LoW is a degree of separation that simply does not exist in most other worker placement games.  As a result, one could re-theme LoW even faster than other such type games.  You could quickly change D&D; flavor text to managing sports teams or the corporate world, both of which involve recruiting.When a game's theme is that interchangeable, that you can quickly change flavor text and have a brand new game with the exact same mechanisms  - that's a flaw.  That's an indication of lack of theme in the worst way.  It also shows a huge amount of dishonesty on the part of the fanboys that a reviewer can't write these things without having the review dinged.  LoW has many positive attributes which I have pointed out. Theme is not one of them.  It shows a clear lack of objectivity to ding a review that is simply pointing out the obvious truth.",3.0,A good game? YES.  Thematic?

It was really inexpensive when I bought it, so even if it was a dud, I didn't feel I would worry about it. The board is well-made, although with the irregular tile size, it is sometimes hard to count your movement out. It really doesn't make a huge difference, but it would have been nice to have clear squares to move around on.The cardstock playing pieces are of average quality.  The treasure and monster cards a little small. Again, adequate to play, but nothing you are going to be wowed over.The game mechanics are rather shallow, but I was expecting this ahead of time. It's a very straightforward dungeon delve, hack n slash game. The dice mechanics are 2d6 with each of the four classes having a single hit number to defeat the monster. If you hit the target number the monster is dead and you get its loot. If you miss, it has a chance to attack back with a handful of random effects. The only wrinkle to combat is the wizard, who gets a couple spells and the ability to teleport to different areas of the board.Once you collect your target GP Value of treasure (classes have different goals), it's a race to the exit and first one there wins. It plays in about 30-45 minutes.I had fun playing it the first time, basically for nostalgia.

We all love treasure. But this game may lose fun when the small pieces go missing. 4 different classes to try to keep alive and win. Cooperative is I good idea to use so everybody wins. Solo is possible but I ran two different classes at the same time to get more fun from the game. I tried one character solo witch is possible but can get boring. But you may play 6 at one time solo but I did not try that. This is playing with others and waiting your turn and adding the dies rolls to attack monsters.

If your family does not include any children under 10 or so you may want to try another game. The rules are overly simplistic and the gameplay depends entirely on the dice - there is very little strategy. The outcomes of each round vary wildly (including a 1-in-12 chance on *every* monster attack that you will lose all of your treasure and have to start over from the very beginning) and there are very few ways to influence the game through skill or strategy.I purchased this taking a chance that it might be a fun addition to a game night among adults but unfortunately it is not.Also, the game itself is frustrating because there are numerous cards you must keep separated: 6 stacks of treasure cards, 6 stacks of monster cards, and 3 stacks of spell cards. All of these cards are smaller than business cards and even more flimsy. There are not enough of each type to shuffle properly, but you have to mix them before each game - that is 15 stacks of tiny, thin cards you need to mix up with your big clunky adult-sized human hands every game. It quickly becomes annoying.As another reviewer mentioned, the usage of the ""Cleared"" tokens is also frustrating. The rooms on the board are quite small and each one requires a token once cleared; a slight bump and they all scatter out of place. In addition, if you roll the dice on the board, you risk knocking over one of many tokens or stand-ups that might be carefully positioned.Clearly this game was designed with kids in mind, which is great, but it's unfortunate that so many online reviews seem to say it's fun for adults.

Specifically, you need a 12 sided die (Called a D12 by the cognoscenti) and up to six regular six sided dice (D6). The game comes with one set, but you will likely need more.That's what you get in this boxed set: One D12 Feat Die, six D6, all in a black/dark gray on off-white color scheme. I asked about different colors when I bought my set and was told that there are no alternatives to this one. Oh well.Why can't you use ""ordinary"" dice of that type? You can. You'll need a crib sheet to make the D12 into a proper ""Feat Die"" but other than that you are good to go.Why bother with these expensive dice then? Well, the D12 Feat Die is properly marked up with opposed faces for the Eye and Gandalf runes for one. That matters to some people. If you use some D12 you have lying around you'll be using the ""11"" and ""12"" faces for those special results and they aren't going to be on opposed faces of the die. Big furry deal, right? But of course, everyone had better be using the *same* faces for those runes if there isn't going to be an almighty real-world fight at some point. The real die avoids this issue.Also, the D6s are marked up so you can quickly tell the ""1"",""2"" and ""3"" faces from the ""4"",""5"" and ""6"" faces which makes evaluating successes very quick indeed. Not only that, the ""6"" face has a special meaning sometimes and it is elaborated upon with even more detail making for unambiguous and easy recognition of that event, should it occur.None of these are show-stoppers for using non-specialized dice, but consider: if you introduce a lot of new players to a One Ring game, how much easier is it to explain the mechanics of the die conventions if you are using this set? A convention GM would consider these money well spent I think. I do.Besides, you should use the right dice for the job or you will annoy and vex the Dice Gods.

They're 8 and 11 years old and I was excited to see them tinkering with what seemed like a ""brain"" toy.The ball is well constructed and provides a fair deal of entertainment as you mess around with how the pieces fit together. The packaging includes a nice booklet about the ball and certain shapes one can make. Unfortunately I found these 2D pictures to be next to useless. What's more is that every shape they showed was very similar to the fully assembled ball. And this brings me to the chief complaint.There just isn't much you can do with these! I tried and tried again with my younger cousins, I'd sit down and say ""Alright, we're going to make something totally different from the ball"" but quite literally every time I tried, I'd come back to the same shape. This is because the pieces are naturally pretty odd and unfortunately don't fit together in lots of interesting ways. And like the other critical reviewer said: if you attempt to make something that doesn't ""lock together"" but is only held together by the magnetic attraction, it will be so slippery and flimsy that you can't do anything with it. The magnets are generally very weak, designed only to pull each piece together for the ball.At this point, I would immediately recommend my favorite desk toy, a cube of neodymium magnet spheres. However, they're very dangerous for young children prone to swallowing them, and not really worth it for any younger kid that can't keep very good track of all 216 magnets (which is very necessary). So, I'll put the decision on you. If you're an adult, I promise you'll enjoy a magnet cube more. If you're buying for a young kid though, this is a good first foray into the world of magnetic tinkering toys. Just keep the cube in mind when they get a bit older.Popular cubes include: Neocube 216pc Magnet Puzzle (Keep Away from Children - Age 14+) and Buckyballs, also available on Amazon (but seemingly not in the catalog of links).",3.0,"Only worthwhile for very young children; otherwise, go for real magnets",1293494400,"12 28, 2010",Toys_and_Games,0,recently get ball cousin Christmas 8 11 year old excited tinker like brain toy ball construct provide fair deal entertainment mess piece fit packaging include nice booklet ball certain shape unfortunately find 2d picture useless shape show similar fully assemble ball bring chief complaint try try young cousin sit alright go totally different ball literally time try come shape piece naturally pretty odd unfortunately fit lot interesting way like critical reviewer say attempt lock hold magnetic attraction slippery flimsy magnet generally weak design pull piece ball point immediately recommend favorite desk toy cube neodymium magnet sphere dangerous young child prone swallow worth young kid good track 216 magnet necessary decision adult promise enjoy magnet cube buy young kid good foray world magnetic tinker toy cube mind bit old popular cube include Neocube 216pc Magnet Puzzle away Children Age 14 + Buckyballs available Amazon seemingly catalog link

We waited until his summer break to open the kit and being working on the book making pages. My son finished his book kit and we mailed it to the company at the end of Aug 2013 in the prepaid, addressed envelope the kit provided. The company's website said it will take 3-4wks to print and return the book. I waited until October to reach out to the company to give them adequate time to follow through on the product. I emailed their Customer Service email address on 10/15 requesting a status on the book. I received a reply within 24hrs saying they were looking into it. I did not hear back, so emailed them again on 10/22, and then on 11/7, and again on 11/18. I still didn't hear anything from their CS, so on 11/21 I tried to hunt down another way to contact them. The ph# on their website referred me back to their website and their FAQs. Their website refers you to their Customer Service email address, which had already proved fruitless. The website provided an email for Erika Brooks for media inquiries, so I forwarded my email string to her. Then I located the domain owner (David McCullough), and I emailed him. I also forwarded my email to the email address of their former CEO (William &#34;Chip&#34; Brunk - according to his LinkedIn profile, he left the company in 2012) hoping that it was still an active email. Finally, I received a reply from their CS within 24hr of sending those three emails. They apologized for their delay and said they would keep me posted. Fast forward to 12/4. I still have not received a reply with any information on my son's book! I read through several reviews on Amazon where other customers were complaining of the same result - no book!

I am able to see his development as a writer by reading these books and he has so much pride seeing works he created on his shelves beside authors such as Dr. Seuss, Jeff Kinney, and E. B. White. My point is, to say we enjoyed Illustory products is an immense understatement. I am also an elementary educator and have used these products as classroom activities in the past. Unfortunately, I no longer feel Illustory is taking a child-centered approach to their dealings with clientele and they are causing more harm to children than good by taking the stories, written by young children, and ignoring their families when they ask where the product they paid for and were eagerly waiting for is. Once an award-winning product, Illustory seems to have fallen into the hands of the careless and incosiderate, and that's the best case scenario.

But I'm only giving it the extra star because of that. I'm still overall unhappy with this company and our most recent books. I won't reiterate the issues that I've already covered. But soon after I wrote this original review I was contacted on here by someone from the company who told me to again follow-up with their customer service dept. So I did. They did get back to me but had no new news for me - my books were still unaccounted for and they'd be in touch. But I never heard back anything.... until a couple of weeks ago when they emailed me to say both of my kids' books had been found and that they were being printed to be delivered soon. I am still uncertain how the books went missing for so long, but FINALLY - five months after sending them in - we received them. But here are the problems I found with the two books:-- Three typographical errors between the two books (such as printing the word ""The"" as ""T he"" with a space between letters). Even my seven-year-old quickly noticed the errors.-- The author photos on each book were distorted, though the pictures I sent in were perfectly fine. One picture was quite blurry, the other had lines going across my son's face, as if the ink didn't print correctly.-- No note of apology, follow-up correspondence  or any kind of offer of compensation to try to make up for their losing our books for several months. Granted this was not a necessity but it would have been in good business practice to do so.Bottom line: I'm glad we finally received our books. Despite their errors on the part of the company, they will still be keepsakes of my kids that I will cherish. However, I plan to research other kid-publishing sites for our next round of book-making. I will not order from this company again. And that's too bad.(ORIGINAL REVIEW:)I am giving this a one-star review based on my recent experience with IlluStory. We had two of these kits, one for each kid, and they took a lot of time coming up with their stories and illustrations. We did everything we were supposed to do to put our kit together (this is not the first time I'd completed one of these so I knew what I was doing.) We chose the option to use the kit and have the kids hand draw their pictures (not to create the books online). The books are limiting in the sense that you can only have 20 words per page and a 12 page limit. This is NOT a lot of words to put together a story. But with a lot of time and editing their words down, we managed to do it. Past kits gave you the option to add pages for a price but this latest kit did not give you the option. I took the time to get pictures of each kids for the ""author photo"" and have the correct size printed & picked up at a nearby store. After ALL of this (weeks and weeks in the making), we shipped out our kits using the pre-printed envelopes they provide, guaranteeing correct address. I sent ours off in August 2013. By October (and many ""Where are our books?"" inquiries from my kids) I began to really wonder, too, where they were. I went back through my emails and realized I couldn't find a confirmation email. I tracked down an email address from somewhere on the Creations by You page and wrote to them, explaining the problem. They got back to me within a few days, but unfortunately with no record of our packages arriving. NEITHER of them (we shipped them in their separate envelopes). I exchanged a few emails with a person from their company but to no avail. I have them book titles, descriptions, kids' names but they said they don't have record of them. The emails on their end seem to have just ended. I received no compensation, no coupons, nothing of any kind of to help re-coup the loss of money, time and completely bummed-out kids on my end. Now maybe this was a fluke. Maybe the post office lost BOTH of the envelopes we shipped out. But then I get on Amazon and see that a couple of the most recent one-star reviews since Nov. 2013 sound very similar to my own problem. So what's the deal? The post office is just losing giant Illustory envelopes, ones that are really big with the IlluStory company name, address and logo emblazoned across the front? I had hoped it was a fluke, because I had used one of these kits a few years ago and we DID get our book back. I still have the same gripe about it being limited in my child being able to tell a story (I paid an extra $11 to add pages so she could finish her story! This was on top of the $20-25 originally paid for the kit.) But in the end she was so excited to be ""published"" that it was a worthwhile keepsake. This is what led me to buy the kits again, this time two of them. So, IlluStory, you tell me ... are you running some kind of scam where you ""don't receive"" just enough packets to fly under the radar or is the post office reaaaallllly losing all of those envelopes?",2.0,"""Two Lost Books""",1386374400,"12 7, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0,update review 1 27 14i'm give 2 star instead 1 star fact FINALLY receive book give extra star overall unhappy company recent book will reiterate issue cover soon write original review contact company tell follow customer service dept new news book unaccounted touch hear couple week ago email kid book find print deliver soon uncertain book go miss long finally month send receive problem find books:-- typographical error book print word T space letter seven year old quickly notice errors.-- author photo book distort picture send perfectly fine picture blurry line go son face ink print correctly.-- note apology follow correspondence   kind offer compensation try lose book month grant necessity good business practice line glad finally receive book despite error company keepsake kid cherish plan research kid publishing site round book making order company bad.(ORIGINAL review:)i give star review base recent experience IlluStory kit kid take lot time come story illustration suppose kit time complete know choose option use kit kid hand draw picture create book online book limit sense 20 word page 12 page limit lot word story lot time edit word manage past kit give option add page price late kit option take time picture kid author photo correct size print pick nearby store week week making ship kit pre printed envelope provide guarantee correct address send August 2013 October book inquiry kid begin wonder go email realize find confirmation email track email address creation page write explain problem get day unfortunately record package arrive ship separate envelope exchange email person company avail book title description kid name say record email end end receive compensation coupon kind help coup loss money time completely bum kid end maybe fluke maybe post office lose envelope ship Amazon couple recent star review Nov. 2013 sound similar problem deal post office lose giant illustory envelope one big IlluStory company address logo emblazon hope fluke kit year ago book gripe limit child able tell story pay extra $ 11 add page finish story $ 20 25 originally pay kit end excited publish worthwhile keepsake lead buy kit time IlluStory tell run kind scam receive packet fly radar post office reaaaallllly lose envelope

Ultimately, though, she was not interested in participating in the tradition, and after learning about it myself I am glad she didn't find it appealing.I have seen posts where some people purchase the elf but decide not to use the elf to report to Santa every day, but rather to simply be a reminder to make good choices. For those of you that this idea appeals to, I was reading about another product, Elf Magic...you might check into that...people say it looks friendlier.There are many blogs and reviews out there...many more that are positive than negative. Many folks say that the elf works to help improve your child's behavior during this month, that as parents we need all the help we can get, and/or that kids enjoy looking for the elf each morning. I have also read many reviews where childrens' first instinct is to be scared and afraid of the elf, and that if you are providing good direction as parents, the elf is not needed and many other Christmas traditions are preferred.For those of you on the fence, I recommend that you read the story yourself before deciding if it's right for your home.

Before Buttface arrived in our home I was at my wits end.  My children would write on the walls with markers, crayons and even oil based paints.  They would swing from the light fixture above our dining room table until it finally was pulled out of the ceiling.  We had been dining by candlelight even since until Joey decided to light little Jimmy's hair on fire one night as they fought over who got the red fork at dinner.  We couldn't even have a Christmas tree because Jack would try and climb it, or we would catch Jimmy swinging at it's trunk with his Boy Scouts ax.  I didn't blame the dear child of course, he was merely using his vivid imagination to play a game of ""Lumberjack"".  Instead we would have the Christmas Shoe Box for Santa to put the presents in.  I don't care what anyone says, it was just as festive as any old tree.  Eventually though I realized that my children were not behaving in a socially acceptable way when the FBI showed up at my door because the boys had called in a bomb threat to get out of a spelling test at school.  Terribly upset, I consulted my pediatrician and we both agreed that my children's behavioral issues were no fault of my own and that the ONLY solution to my discipline problems was ""The Elf on The Shelf"".I brought Buttface out of his box the day after Thanksgiving.  For the entire month of December Jimmy, Joey and Jack were perfect angels.  Cowering in abject fear over this tiny stuffed doll they behaved as well as the baby Jesus himself.  It did make for a few night time bed wetting accidents as they were afraid to get out of bed at night for fear Buttface would be lurking in the hallway.  Not once did they bite the dog, cut my hair while I slept or try to hotwire the car.  It was a new record in our home.  We actually got to have a tree that year and I thought my parenting troubles were over!!  Bless you Buttface!However, on December 26th, giddy with all the loot Santa had bought, which was a lot since they had been so extra good with the help of Buttface, my children knew they were off the hook for the next 11 months!  They were back at it again, tipping over our refrigerator, trying to bathe the cat in the dishwasher and scamming old ladies out of their retirement by claiming to be princes from Nigeria in some email scam they had running.So, in despair, I am asking that there be an elf of this nature to spy on my children and keep them on the straight and narrow year round!  I know it would make my life a whole lot easier to know that I had an inanimate object in my house that was keeping my children on the straight and narrow and could take over the parenting duties on a daily basis, not just at Christmas time.  Parenting is very hard work and we need all the help we can get.

However, this is a far-cry from anything magical; potentially causing more ""harm"" than good. Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas for all the right reasons, but this is simply not one of them.To some, ""Elf on the Shelf"" may appear to be a harmless, charming, and ""all-watching"" doll for the fantasy and adoration of children. Remove the ""fantasy and charm"" from the equation, and you've got nothing short of a creepy ""spy"" of sorts. For me, and many others, it is an intimidating symbol for the behavior modification of children; an unwritten ""threat,"" if you will.I must fully concede that in my childhood, I was scared of anything that I believed was ""watching me."" Having read books where animals ""come to life"" is not always a positive one. Sometimes the intent (construed by the child) may be to ""cause harm."" I know that I am not alone in this suggestion, as I've seen similar posts from others. The suggestion to move this figure around the home (or wherever) so that it can ""watch"" the children may be a very scary proposal, and one you might want to discuss before buying.  If my parents had had one of these things when I was in my childhood...I would have absolutely freaked out! No, not in a good way either.From the vast numbers of comments (good and bad) that I've read, it appears that so many proponents of this overly commercialized franchise are using it as a psychological ""tool"" of sorts. Hey, nothing like having a ""spy-cam"" converted into an Elf, right? Whether or not you agree, that is essentially what this thing is doing. And yes, for those of you who wonder if I've even ""read the book?"" I have; cute book -- scary doll.My suggestion to parents boils down to this - talk to your children FIRST! Don't think that this is guaranteed to be received as a ""good surprise"" for the Holiday Season. Some will, and definitely, some won't. The suggestion that this ""Elf"" will make your children ""behave well,"" is just about as misguided as the parents who buy Baby Einstein videos/books; believing their child will be the next child prodigy or Nobel Prize winner - despite the fact there's simply no evidence that they work, much less, ever been tested (which they haven't).If you're that worried about the behavior of your children and what they're up to, invest in a wireless security camera(s).

It sounded like a cute little game that would build up the kitty's anticipation for Christmas. A simple game where the parent hides the elf around the house and the kid looks for it in the morning. The legend is that the elf spies on the kid, and then reports back to Santa every night. Not only did it sound fun, but it was one more way to black mail the little turds into being good around the holidays. Well worth the price of 24 bucks...or so I thought.Well, things started out as you could expect. I would come home in the evening and tell the kids to grab me a beer while I would sit down to watch TV. They would ignore me, an act that usually resulted with me yelling, and throwing my shoes at them, but with the magic of Christmas in the air, and Pedro on the shelf (the name given to our elf by the kids) my frosty malted beverage would find its way to my hand within a minute. Just when I was really starting to like the novelty (although I was still a little piffed as to why our version turned out to be a Puerto Rican elf), things took a turn for the worse.It started when my daughter asked me one night why the elf liked to spy on her. I told her that it was because he would let Santa know whenever she was naughty. She asked what that meant, and I proceeded to explain to her that it meant that he would basically rat her out whenever she did something bad, like wet the bed. Well as luck would have it, that very night she had a little ""accident"", and because she was afraid that the elf would tell on her, she decided to hide the soiled sheet under her bed. Well about a week later the whole room wreaked of urine and tears. That was strike one for the elf.The second strike came one morning when the kiddos were looking for the sneaky little guy. I had hid itThe night before, but by this time I had a little game of my own going on. See, I would get all crazy on wine and pain killers whenever I would hide it, that way it was a game for me to find it in the morning myself! A little way to bring some holiday magic for myself as well. Anyway, after about an hour and a half the elf was still MIA, and I had lost interest in ever finding the little SOB again. As many will agree, children are much more persistent than adults when it comes to these things, so they were still going strong trying to find the little man. It finally got to the point where I couldn't take it any longer and I howled out that Christmas was make believe, Santa was fake, the elf was a hoax, and there was no Jesus. Well they all start crying, and only stopped when they found the elf five minutes later. I had placed it in a provocative position with one of the dogs squeaky toys. I had to answer a lot of questions about the birds and the bees for the next several hours. About the least desirable thing to do when your nursing one heck of a hangover, I'll tell you that much. They were finally satisfied that old Pedro probably had a little too much tequila the night before, and had decided to find himself an unclean lady of the night. Strike two.The third and final strike occurred when they decided to play elf on the shelf one day after school. My eldest was going to play the part of the elf, while the youngest of my brood was going to play herself (not creative in the least but what do you expect from a kid that hides her urine soaked sheets under the bed). Well, while the old one was looking for a good hiding spot, he ended up coming across my stash of Asian fetish porn. Apparently he found something he liked because I find him in the closet all the time looking at the magazines. Sick little pervert.

They can scout a room to see what it is, with very little to almost no fear of death. Heroes can also on their pick up new adventurers or items to help them. To gain points Heroes need to venture into a room to successfully defeat it, and collect the room's points to win the game.The Guardian get to build the dungeon with the starting cards, in what ever order that they want to. On the Guardian's turn they get to draw a card, play a card, play a room down, or pick up a certain amount of rooms and rearrange them, as long as they have not been scouted.Game is over when the treasure room (from the starting dungeon cards) is successfully ventured, when the Guardian has successfully taken all the cards from his dungeon card deck (then tries to pull another one, when there isn't one), or I would assume if there are no more adventurers (see below).WHAT DID I LIKE ABOUT THE GAME:I like the artwork. I like the concept of this game. I like so many things about this game. But I don't like winning this game. It feels cheap and sad when I win the game because the adventurers didn't stand a chance, due to bad die rolls, lucky hand on my part at the beginning, or just because the only way the Heroes can win the game is by mastering a special balance of picking up, playing cards, and venturing rooms.However back to things I like about the game. I think the game has a pretty nice area to work within, and with a little tweaking I would love this game. It has a nice concept a fresh game play (as fresh as a game play like this can be).WHAT DID I DISLIKE ABOUT THE GAME:I hate the dragon tear player action system. I've read the rule over 10 times, and I am still confused by it.The Venture/Scout missions are interesting, but I feel it's lacking in part.All in all, I feel the game gets pretty boring once you know you are going to win as the Guardian. I felt like I had to give the Hero's a chance to win. So I started just not doing anything on my turn. Then on the second play through, I discovered that it was possible that the Guardian can so masterfully build his dungeon as to kill all the adventurers. All of them. I killed all of them, and no where in the rules does it state that it is an end game prerequisite. So I just treated it as such, since I the Hero's couldn't do anything else.WHO IS THIS GAME DESIGNED FOR?The artwork is cutesy. The game could be set up for people who like D&D;, but I don't think it will sit well with those people. It's to dumbed down, and too cutesy for them. It will likely be a good game for a not so serious gamer.WHAT WOULD FIX THE GAME?I don't normally do this. They succeeded in making a game, where others, myself included, have failed. While I feel like a punk suggesting a change, I kinda feel that I have to in this situation. The game is very centered around the Guardian, and I think additional adventurers, and more action cards for the adventurers, like spells, would help the game. Therefore a simple expansion might be all the game needs! Get to it, and if it fixes the game, I will be one of the first to purchase it, and change my review if need be!RATING!2.8 out of 8.

With that said, though, when I'm invited to a party, it's usually with a group of ten to twenty people who are already familiar in at least one way or another.The idea behind the game is to have everyone compete for beads (it's so much easier to ""win"" beads in New Orleans, at least for the ladies) that each person wears around their neck.  In order to win the beads, you have to convince someone to perform a task posted on the 300 cards provided with the game.  The cards are broken into five categories:  Mind Control, Caught In The Act, Talk It Out, Fashion Police, Go Crazy & Challenge.  Once they perform the task or fit the description on the card, you collect the number of beads that the card says to take.When the game is over, the person with the most beads wins.I personally believe that this game works best at office parties and/or conventions as an icebreaker for people who either rarely talk to each other or are meeting for the first time.  Also, I highly recommend adding alcohol to the game for the simple fact that it will loosen up people a bit in order to get things going.If you have a bunch of friends over at your house whom you are already familiar with, you can take the game a step farther and add your own tasks to help keep the game interesting.Overall, a decent game to play with a very large group.

The game is well-designed and fun to play.  The dice are of solid casting and very clear to read.

Of course, given that it's a dice game, that's to be expected.  I guess even real-life football has a bit of chaos to it, with fumbles going both ways, penalties, etc.  I suppose my disappointment with the game is that it's not really ""strategic"" at all.  You're completely at the mercy of the die rolls.  As it is, you're rolling three dice with a number from 0-3 on them, and the ""big play"" die which has numbers in the double-digits and ""TD"" on it.  I think it'd be better if you could choose to roll ""rushing"" dice or ""passing"" dice, with the appropriate yardage counts on each.  At least that would add a little strategy.  Or perhaps have offensive and defensive dice.

When the pricing game out, the worry increased. When these expansions were actually released, the elation was minimal.First off, the actual game content. The mechanism for this character is interesting and is as fun as all the others from Red Dragon Inn 3. While I like the little player gimmick, I've always felt the original Red Dragon Inn 1 and 2 characters were more subtle in their flavor and not immediately obvious with their strategies like these more modern character decks. It's mostly a personal taste thing, but I would give it a 4 out of 5.So why the 2 out of 5? Value for the money is pretty awful, as all the parts in this expansion are gimped. The player board is miniscule compared to the conventional boards. Gone are the nice red and clear fortitude/alcohol markers and now it's cardboard. Even the coins are gimped as they are smaller than the original game. While the Allies expansions seem like an inexpensive way to add a single extra player without having to buy another whole 4-player set, the extra player components are definitely 2nd class and no one playing the game wants to get stuck using these components. Plus, particularly with the gold, mixing the regular sized coins with these mini coins just makes a mess of the game flow, really. Some of these component decisions don't make sense at all because the mood marker is a glass drop!The component quality of the base game is already somewhat marginal, especially in the cards themselves being rather lacking in springiness and zero texture and having a nasty curl right from unwrapping, so these additional cost cuts just really makes it feel like they've phoned it in. Add the insult of an Allies expansion costing almost 40% of what a full 4 player set costs and it is really an unacceptable gouge of RDI fans.While the character IS fun, honestly it should be priced more around 20% of the full game price considering it's not any more advanced than the decks you get with RDI 3, has no drink deck, and includes components no one will want to use.",2.0,Allies: the gimp expansions,1385683200,"11 29, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0,announce stand character elated worried end result pricing game worry increase expansion actually release elation minimal actual game content mechanism character interesting fun Red Dragon Inn 3 like little player gimmick feel original Red Dragon Inn 1 2 character subtle flavor immediately obvious strategy like modern character deck personal taste thing 4 5.so 2 5 value money pretty awful part expansion gimp player board miniscule compare conventional board gone nice red clear fortitude alcohol marker cardboard coin gimp small original game Allies expansion like inexpensive way add single extra player have buy 4 player set extra player component definitely 2nd class play game want stuck component plus particularly gold mix regular sized coin mini coin make mess game flow component decision sense mood marker glass drop!the component quality base game somewhat marginal especially card lack springiness zero texture have nasty curl right unwrap additional cost cut make feel like phone add insult Allies expansion cost 40 4 player set cost unacceptable gouge RDI fan character fun honestly price 20 game price consider advanced deck RDI 3 drink deck include component want use

We were excited to add her to the mix and try some new strategies.Natyli's kind of adorable, though she's a bit off. She's Phrenk's (RDI3) niece, which is a nice touch. She's drawn very anime style in comparison to other characters, and her dolls are all very humorously drawn to match the rest of the RDI cast.Natyli's deck has a really nice range of Action cards, and she has the ability to cast one of her hexes (which remain on a character until the hex succeeds or Natyli is knocked out) during Gambling. Her hexes are very cool to use, but Natyli has some serious drawbacks that make her overwhelmingly underpowered against the decks of 2, 3 and 4.Natyli has few defense cards of any kind - she's easy to drink under the table, easy to steal gold from, and easy to knock out. To place a hex, she must successfully hit with an action card (she does have one or two Anytime hexes) or successfully cheat in Gambling. Her most powerful hex, in my opinion, is the Power Hex (reduces all numeric effects during an action phase by 1), and it can simply be passed back to Natyli by passing one's Action Phase. Once Natyli gets to one on one (IF she makes it that far, she is almost always the first character out in our four person games) she's almost guaranteed to fail to hex her target or build any meaningful offense or defense. If she is played as a Gambler, she becomes a huge target for the enormous pile of gold she gains while being unable to defend it or herself.In short - Natyli was a cool idea, but all three of the other RDI Allies are stronger, better characters to use (though Pooky has his faults, too). Natyli is simply woefully unprepared to actually sit with a group of hardened adventurers who have more than enough defense to block her while she has little available to save herself from retaliation.",3.0,"A good addition, but not a strong character",1392681600,"02 18, 2014",Toys_and_Games,0,Natyli recently add near complete collection RDI excited add mix try new strategy Natyli kind adorable bit Phrenk RDI3 niece nice touch draw anime style comparison character doll humorously draw match rest RDI cast Natyli deck nice range action card ability cast hex remain character hex succeed Natyli knock Gambling hex cool use Natyli drawback overwhelmingly underpowered deck 2 3 4.natyli defense card kind easy drink table easy steal gold easy knock place hex successfully hit action card anytime hex successfully cheat Gambling powerful hex opinion Power Hex reduce numeric effect action phase 1 simply pass Natyli pass Action Phase Natyli get make far character person game guarantee fail hex target build meaningful offense defense play Gambler huge target enormous pile gold gain unable defend short Natyli cool idea RDI ally strong well character use Pooky fault Natyli simply woefully unprepared actually sit group harden adventurer defense block little available save retaliation

As soon as I opened the box, I knew my money had been flushed down the toilet. I played this game with another person ONE time for an agonizing 10 or 15 minutes before chucking it back in its box and then into the garbage.First of all, the game rules are so simple a chimp could have devised them. Each player begins his/her turn by rolling a die which will determine the level of difficulty the next spelling word will be. The other player draws an index card and reads the word: ""Spell _____ ."" The player tries to spell the word. If successful, the player is rewarded by filling the places in his/her honeycomb with the appropriate number of pieces. After this is done, or if the player spells the word incorrectly, it is the next player's turn.I thought this game might be good for helping my students learn how to spell. However, the levels of difficulty in this game are very skewed. You are either going to get a simple word in very common usage or a vague, highly-specialized word of foreign origins (including French and Japanese!) Also, the game pieces are very low-quality. The game board is cut so that it can fold four ways, simultaneously saving space and making it ugly to look at. Even worse, the honeycomb pieces used to keep score are tiny hexagonal cardboard pieces that are hard to distinguish from the game board. Two of the colors in the honeycomb are so close that they cannot be readily distinguished from each other.The effect of all these poorly conceived elements is a rapid buildup of boredom and agony. I can't imagine anyone ever having fun playing this.

While Awkward Moment sounds perfect for preteens and teens -- a ripe demographic for awkward moments -- it's just not that interesting.Here's a random hand from the game:Moment card = ""You're asked to tutor your classmates in algebra.""Decider card = ""Easiest to do""So....each player must lay down a card from their hand that represents the thing easiest to do in the ""moment"" of being asked to tutor classmates in algebra.Here's my hand (I have to choose one of these cards):1. ""I know you are, but what am I?""2. ""Use E.S.P. and read minds.""3. ""Your accent isn't fooling anyone.""4. ""Bury your head in your textbook.""5. ""Go walk 500 miles. Then go walk 500 more.""I choose ""Bury your head in your textbook"" as the easiest thing to do. The decider of this round looks at all the submitted cards and chooses the winner. I end up winning the round. Ho hum.Some of us tried to submit the funniest or most absurd or ironic choices, but the choices weren't that funny.

The cards were easy to shuffle, though with two hundred plus cards involved in the reaction deck, you may want an extra pair of hands.  The manual was easy to follow, but failed to include winning and game ending conditions. Luckily, the game is freeform enough to where players can make up their own and quit when they want to.  For a longer game, players can reshuffle the discard piles as the decks run out, just to name an example.Before moving on to gameplay, I thought I'd quickly mention and applaud the game for having so many variants listed in the manual.  I counted seven different variants for players to try, including ""Double the Awkward, Double the Fun?"", ""The Old Awkward Switcheroo"", ""It's Kind of an Awkward Story"", ""Ackward-Acting"", ""Choose Your Own Awkward"", ""Awkward Momentum"", and ""Decreasingly Awkward"".  Each of them describes changes that are fairly significant.  ""The Old Awkward Switcheroo"", for example, has players drawing and submitting moment cards instead of reaction cards.  ""It's Kind of an Awkward Story"" encourages role-playing and story telling, for those of you who enjoy fictional writing.  I won't go into all of them, but they definitely add a lot of replay value to the base game.In fact, coming up with our own variant is what made our play experience somewhat manageable.  The moment and decider cards make ""Awkward Moment"" feel a bit more structured and on-task when compared to ""Apples to Apples"". The group didn't seem to care for the decider cards...they felt that they made things overly confusing and too specific.  During one turn, we drew twenty different decider cards and none of them seemed to fit the situation at hand.  After about ten turns, we decided to do away with the decider cards altogether and increased our reaction card hand limit to ten.  This helped things a little, but I'm sorry to say that the majority of the group wanted to play ""Apples to Apples"" instead.  Jennifer didn't seem to find the cards funny, and the specific nature of the game kept us from being imaginative with the cards.  It's worth noting that our group is very sarcastic and witty...this is more than likely why games like ""Say Anything"" and ""Apples to Apples"" work better for us, as they encourage creativity.At the end of the day, ""Awkward Moment"" is an interesting family-friendly card game that is worthy of your attention.  Its small size makes it ideal for travel, especially when it's going to be used for parties and/or vacations.  The extra variants keeps things from getting dull, giving players a reason to bring out the box a second or third time.  There is a bit of reading comprehension involved, so parents will need to decide if their kids are ready when considering the 12+ age recommendation.  The price tag is listed at $19.00 (as of 7-22-13), which I feel to be fair and on par with other games of the genre.  While our group didn't particularly enjoy this game, that's not to say that you won't.

{'$oid': '5a13282c741a2384e879c9a1'},A3UHHA7YYFPJ8V,0984608028,Stantz,"[6, 8]","In my opinion, there are two types of gamers - the hardcore gamers who love the nuances of a 100-page rule book, and the casual yet intelligent gamer looking for something more interesting than Monopoly. In recent years, games like Settlers and Ticket To Ride and even Flying Frog's Last Night On Earth have found wider acceptance as the latter audience has grown.What bugs me about the Flying Frog games I've played is that they seem to exist in an annoying place between hardcore and casual. They're not complicated enough to be considered under the super serious heading, but they're often just a little too convoluted for a more casual ""teach as you go"" session. And I wouldn't mind if the complications made the game better - but honestly, the things thrown in just feel totally arbitrary.First, Fortune & Glory, like other FF games, is GORGEOUS. The attention to detail is amazing. The pieces and cards and artwork...a gamer's dream. And the theme is exactly what you want it to be: Indiana Jones in your living room. And yet it's not been particularly liked by my casual gamer friends for two reasons.One, the rules are unnecessarily complicated and as unstreamlined as you can get. Like, at the start of each round, all players roll to see who goes first. If you get a 1, you get a Free Event card. BUT. If there's a tie, you don't get a free event card. Why? Why not? It doesn't make any sense, and yet this is one of a zillion little rules you have to remember to get through the game.I wrote out the rules on a cheat sheet, and re-reading it as I'm writing this, it's insane how overcomplicated this game is, in part because each element of the game has a different system you have to remember. And honestly, I just don't think it had to be this way, as the fundamentals they're getting at are very clear cut. Travel to a land; overcome dangers to retrieve an artifact; sell it in a city and eventually win the game. Along the way, boost your character's stats to make the process easier.Seems simple, except that every step of the way has a system that you have to remember, each with its own set of doesn't-really-make-sense exceptions. For example, on your actual turn, you will either be in a city, on a non-city land space, or adventuring for treasure. If you're in a city, draw a City card and see what happens to you. If you're on a random land piece, roll a die. On a 1, you fight. On a 2,3, nothing happens. On a 4,5,6 draw an event card. If you're adventuring, draw cards to face dangers. The disparate nature of each option makes the structure of the game feel very arbitrary.The second problem is that, because you're playing against the game instead of rival players, it can get tedious waiting for other players to go. The game involves rolling lots of dice checks that only affect your character and no one else, and it's easy to tune out after the initial novelty of the theme starts to wear off. There are some card-based ways to sort of screw up other players, but for the most part, you're in your own world, and I think it's too bad there's not a more cutthroat edge to the game.I hope I've been clear about why I've given it three stars. I like complicated games; I do not like overcomplicated games. Fortune & Glory, on the other hand, has a steep steep learning curve, and I just don't feel the reward of knowing all 200 rules or so is worth the benefit of the overcomplication.But it's SUCH a beautiful game that I still urge you to try it yourself, especially if you're more in the hardcore gamer category.

My thought process literally went like this, ""Miskatonic?! The boards are PADDLES?? Deckbuilder?!?!?! It's a Kickstarter?!?!""SOLD!Overall, Miskatonic is a fun game. If you are familiar with other deck builders, Miskatonic can be a little wonky to pick up.My boyfriend and I are both fairly experienced gamers and we were scratching our heads a bit figuring out this game.I'm not going to say we weren't drunk and slaphappy when we were first trying, but I still highly recommend checking out the instructional video from the creator. The link is included in the rule book and it makes things much clearer.The main difference between Miskatonic and 'normal' deck builders is you must buy a card for yourself and your opponent every turn. There are 'free' options if you decide to spend your money getting more powerful students, or meaner substitutes. Then the cards you bought don't go in a discard pile to be shuffled in later, they go into your 'purchase' pile, to be immediately accessed the next turn. Then when it's time to fight one of the faculty, you draw a random 'BFF' from your deck and hope for the best.This mechanic keeps game play consistent, but makes it difficult to strategize. I would say this is a great game for casual gamers, but for me personally it's a little 'meh.' We bring it out when we don't want to put a lot of thought into gaming. The replay value is also a little blah because all the turns pretty much play the same.Here's the TL:DR version -Pros:* Super fun Lovecraft references all over* Fast game play once everyone's familiar* Art and theme are definitely interesting and add to the game* Fun to buy cards to screw your friendsCons:* Too much randomness for strategy* There don't seem to be a lot of 'good' choices in re: students* Hard to break old deck building habits if you're a fan of the style of game* This game caps at four players, so it is not suitable for bigger groups.Overall, this is an okay game. I don't regret adding it to my collection and it does get requests every once in awhile to come out, but it lacks the depth and replayability I like in my games.

I love Lovecraftian games, they have consistently been very fun and interesting which is what drew me to this game in the first place.Let's start with the good.  The art is absolutely adorable.  The cards and boards are high quality and very durable.  Its clear the designers went into a lot of thought when designing the overall look and feel of the physical pieces in the game.  There are also some very interesting and new game mechanics that I was very eager to try out.  In the game you build both your own deck and your opponents', which definitely piqued my interest.Once I started playing, however, the game definitely lost its shine.  The rules are terribly written, making them almost unusable.  Videos exist which explain how it is played, apparently, I would STRONGLY suggest looking one of those up.  The rules never cleared up any questions we had when learning the game and barely got us through our first fumbled attempts at playing.Let's move on to game play.  The game itself is horribly unbalanced.  Maybe the fact that it was Kickstarted didn't give it enough time to be play tested?  I'm not really sure.  Some cards are practically useless and others are horribly overpowering.  I played one game where I lost all 20 of my sanity points when my opponent lost absolutely none.  If things like that happen (repeatedly) you know the game is severely broken.Overall, the lovely art and quality pieces aren't enough to compensate for shotty game mechanics which just make for an overall un-fun experience playing.

{'$oid': '5a13282c741a2384e879ca30'},AJ736TV2307E9,0992251656,Erik,"[5, 7]","This is a review by someone who's never watched the show, nor seen the movie.There's aspects of this game I enjoy, but most of this game is tedious.  You are going to spend a lot of time watching other people roll dice while you wait for your turn.  The missions simply take too long to complete.  The mission cards say that they should take 2 hours to complete, but in practice, it always ends up taking over three hours.  I thought that this was because my friends and I were just getting familiar with the rules, but we've been playing this game for a while, and it still takes forever to complete a single game.There's just way too many ways for the game to screw you over.  A lot of missions require you to play what are known as 'Aim to Misbehave' cards to complete the mission.  These are cards that &#34;test&#34; your various stats, such as firearms, negotiate, etc.  You generally have to play through 3 or 4 of these cards to complete a mission.  In order to give yourself a reasonable chance at passing the dice rolls, you need to have great stats.  So for example, one of the tests will say you can pass with 8+ skill in firearms.  With a max roll of 6 on a die, you minimally need a firearm skill of 2.  It's great when you have a maxed out crew with lots of equipment, but with lesser stats, it becomes a chore to have to constantly roll dice and retry from the beginning once you fail.  Sometimes, no amount of skill will help you.  There are cards that will instantly botch your job, and they force you to restart your Aim to Misbehave cards all over again on your next turn.  Since a lot of the missions, and usually the main game mission, require going through a lot of these cards, there's a lot of dice rolling and a lot of random events that force you to start over on the task again.  This game either needs to streamline this process by reducing the amount of Aim to Misbehave cards required for jobs, or remove the instant fail cards.  It's simply not fun to go through these, because there's no skill involved.  It's just bunch of dice rolling and praying that you don't draw an instant fail card.Even the act of flying gets tedious.  You can move one square without burning fuel, or you can expend one fuel to possibly move up to five spaces.  What flying really means is: draw flight cards and pray you don't get a random event.  Again, like the Aim to Misbehave cards, there's simply too many random events that can cause you to come to a full stop and lose your turn, not to mention the fuel you just wasted.  Some of the events can be mitigated by having the right crew members. For instance, if you get a breakdown, you can avoid the event by having a mechanic.  If you don't, you either have to come to a full stop or spend a 'parts' token to fix the problem.  This would be less of an issue if these &#34;bad&#34; cards were less common, but they occur too often.  A person's turn can take minutes of deciding on how to interact with an event.  I've had cases where I've seen players stuck in one spot for several turns because they kept drawing cards that they didn't have either the right crew or right equipment to bypass.  Getting stuck for a few turns doesn't sound bad, but when you consider how long it takes for each person to get through their turn in this game, it's bad and boring.As I said at the beginning, there are some things about this game I enjoy.  The aspect of hiring crew and buying equipment is sort of fun.  It's cool that you can customize your crew and ship with all sorts of equipment.  It's sort of fun to perform some of the missions that are more straightforward, like the pickup and delivery missions, but is all this really worth sinking 3+ hours into?  I don't think that it is.  I could see this working better as a single player game.Ways I think this game could be improved:- Reduce the amount of Aim to Misbehave cards required for jobs- Reduce the amount of event cards in the flying decks- Allow you to move 2 spaces without expending fuel- Allow three actions per turn, or at least always allow you to move, regardless of what your other two actions were.",2.0,"A significant time investment, without much in return.",1396742400,"04 6, 2014",Toys_and_Games,0,review watch see movie aspect game enjoy game tedious   go spend lot time watch people roll dice wait turn   mission simply long complete   mission card 2 hour complete practice end take hour   think friend get familiar rule play game take forever complete single game way way game screw   lot mission require play know aim Misbehave card complete mission   card 34;test&#34 stat firearm negotiate etc   generally play 3 4 card complete mission   order reasonable chance pass dice roll need great stat   example test pass 8 + skill firearm   max roll 6 die minimally need firearm skill 2   great maxe crew lot equipment less stat chore constantly roll dice retry beginning fail   skill help   card instantly botch job force restart Aim Misbehave card turn   lot mission usually main game mission require go lot card lot dice rolling lot random event force start task   game need streamline process reduce Aim Misbehave card require job remove instant fail card   simply fun skill involve   bunch dice roll pray draw instant fail card act flying get tedious   square burn fuel expend fuel possibly space   fly mean draw flight card pray random event   like Aim Misbehave card simply random event cause come stop lose turn mention fuel waste   event mitigate have right crew member instance breakdown avoid event have mechanic   come stop spend part token fix problem   issue 34;bad&#34 card common occur   person turn minute decide interact event   case see player stick spot turn keep draw card right crew right equipment bypass   get stuck turn sound bad consider long take person turn game bad boring say beginning thing game enjoy   aspect hire crew buying equipment sort fun   cool customize crew ship sort equipment   sort fun perform mission straightforward like pickup delivery mission worth sink 3 + hour   think   work well single player game way think game improved:- reduce Aim Misbehave card require jobs- reduce event card fly decks- allow 2 space expend fuel- allow action turn allow regardless action

Having played three games (two solo, one with my wife), I'm pretty comfortable writing a brief review.Pros: This is a great visual gift for any fan of the series. Every card features a character, object, or place featured in the show. The flavor text on the cards also comes from the show, and gives the player an excuse to speak as though in the 'Verse. The solo mode is great for learning the game, or for when another player isn't available. Buying the game makes the Firefly brand a more profitable enterprise, encouraging future products.Cons: I feel the game manual isn't very clear, and often requires flipping between pages to find the scattered bits of rules you need. This game has a lot of pieces (13 decks of cards, 13 discard piles, player place settings with associated cards) and when combined with the huge board, it has a rather large footprint. Successfully completing many of the randomly drawn &#34;Misbehave&#34; action cards requires having previously attained specific other cards, but as those action cards are random there is no way to know which other cards are needed ahead of time. Completing those action cards also require you to roll dice and attain a given number (or higher), and while &#34;crew&#34; cards give bonuses towards the number rolled, I frequently find myself either with bonuses that equal or exceed the number required to complete the action even prior to rolling the dice, or lacking enough bonuses to make completion of the action anything approaching likely. Even after completing an action card, I don't commonly feel as though I'm making progress towards the endgame. The &#34;job&#34; cards that award the money or items that are required for the endgame goals are sometimes also drawn at random, and may also require you to have previously attained specific other cards.Overall: I think this makes a fun gift for someone who is a tabletop gamer AND a fan of the series. However, if stripped of the thematic elements, I'm not sure I would play it. I know there are at least two expansions in the works, so perhaps those will address some of the &#34;Cons&#34; I noted above.",3.0,"Great Theme, Mediocre Game",1388016000,"12 26, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0,friend dedicate browncoat give game holiday present having play game solo wife pretty comfortable write brief review pro great visual gift fan series card feature character object place feature flavor text card come give player excuse speak verse solo mode great learn game player available buy game make Firefly brand profitable enterprise encourage future product con feel game manual clear require flip page find scatter bit rule need game lot piece 13 deck card 13 discard pile player place setting associated card combine huge board large footprint successfully complete randomly draw 34;misbehave&#34 action card require having previously attain specific card action card random way know card need ahead time complete action card require roll dice attain give number high 34;crew&#34 card bonus number roll frequently find bonus equal exceed number require complete action prior roll dice lack bonus completion action approach likely complete action card commonly feel make progress endgame 34;job&#34 card award money item require endgame goal draw random require previously attain specific card overall think make fun gift tabletop gamer fan series strip thematic element sure play know expansion work address 34;cons&#34 note

Do legal jobs, and you don't incur any danger.  But you also make almost no money.  Do illegal or immoral jobs for a high payout!  Also there are two decks you have to flip cards from when you are flying in either Alliance or Border space.  Good mechanic because it allows for all the danger of navigating the black to show through.Gameplay: 0 Stars.  And here is where the game comes to a 'monkeys must be loose in the engine room' halt.  The designers say the game is sandbox style.  Go anywhere.  Do anything you want.  Sure.  And loose while other people just do the exact strategy to win.  First game we played, I was surprised at how few turns it took for someone to win the game.  He got 3 delivery jobs.  Did some muck work, and paid Niska.  Wham, bam, thank you maam.  Kiss your dear fluffy lord goodbye.  Ok, maybe that was a fluke.  Game 2.  Almost the same results.  But this time with a different player.  We even tried to stop him.  I flew around in border space till I could get the Reavers on the Hunt card so another buddy of mine could intercept him.  Yeah, crew dead, he doesn't care.  Still pays Niska and wins.  Ugh.So maybe that was just a coincidence.  We get together another time and play one of the other box scenarios.  And I learn how to break the game and win every time.  Do you want to know how to do it?  Seriously, in the next couple sentences I will spoil the game for you, and give you the secret to winning.  Are you sure you want to know?  Yes?  Yes?  SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Go to either Badger or Amnon Duul and consider jobs, do crap work (collect $200) till you get three either delivery jobs, or low misbehave jobs (1 card or 2 at the most!).  Go hire some crew (Silverhold is a pretty good place).  Complete the jobs.  Repeat ad nauseam.  Lame.  But there you go.  And yes it does work.  Since I discovered that strategy I HAVEN'T LOST A GAME!  And I played with new and seasoned players.  That is the biggest letdown in the world.Also some of our other players were really frustrated by the fact that all it takes is one lousy card to completely wreck your game.  Hit the card that draws the Reaver or Alliance ship to you, and by the draw of one stupid card you can straight up loose!  Another annoyance, Niska jobs suck!  Sure they pay a lot.  But they take a very varied skill set crew or you won't be able to beat all the misbehave cards you will have to draw.  Also you don't make that much more in the long run.  Doing the slightly lesser but way less risk jobs is the way to go.I know this review will probably garner me a lot of down votes.  But I don't care.  I'm a huge gamer through and through and I hope to warn other people to avoid this game.  Thematically it is brilliant and beautiful.  But in the play, it is way less than shiney.  I have boxed this game and will move on to other bigger and better games.But to leave the review on a positive note, I will leave you with some words of wisdom from captain Mal:You can learn all the math in the 'verse... but you take a boat in the air that you don't love... she'll shake you off just as sure as the turn of the worlds.

The first story Cinderella worked fine but the other 3 books would only play half way through the book or start but then stop.  The worst part about my whole experience with Storyreader is their customer service.  Initially when I called they wouldn't replace the books.  When I called the second time, the rep was easy about replacing them.  This whole process started in Feb 2011 and it is now May 2011 and I still haven't received my replacement books.  They have the worst customer service. The number you call is supposed to help with troubleshooting but they cannot even answer the simple question of when my order was shipped.  They will transfer you and then take a message.  I had to keep calling them back after waiting a week at a time because no one would call back.  Every time you call them you have to repeat your whole story again, they don't seem to have any info on past conversations.  It was only until I became irate with them that they finally passed me onto their supervisor.  To clarify, in the months that have passed they did send me replacement books, not Princess stories but Elmo.  My daughter is 6 and has no interest in Elmo (never has.) I would have expected that knowing the books I was waiting for they would have sent replacement books that are in the same age/topic category.  I did try one of the Elmo books and surprise surprise, not only did it not work but it was incompatible with my reader system.  Ours was the old version and the books sent us were the new version.

If your Titan dies, you're out of the game and get to watch for a few hours as people finish up.  This game has a lot of a ""Risk"" feel to it.  And it shares all of the flaws of Risk at the same time.  But your Titan has Legions to defend it, and you can muster more if you land on the right land types.  This is an interesting mechanic, as different land types produce different unit types.  They produce a ""tree"" on each land type.  So multiple units of one kind can muster one more powerful type, and multiple units of the more powerful type can combine for an even more powerful type.  This would be a great mechanic....but it's all based on the roll of the die to get to those land types, so you can't really strategize if the die screws you over, then someone else beats you down if you miss too many rounds of mustering to follow up the way you want to go.  If you just go with whatever the dice gives you, your forces can be...underwhelming.I'm sure that there's some sort of strategy, but I found many games where I'd be sitting on the base units or second tier units and others had already upgraded two or three times just because I couldn't roll what I needed.  That was pet peeve #1.  It's extremely frustrating.In another interesting mechanic all combat takes place on side boards specifically based on the terrain type you're on.  That was pretty cool.  Certain units get bonuses in different terrain types and the special types of hexes that can be in terrains (such as bogs in swamps).  Now to pet peeve #2.  Combat all takes place by dice rolling.  You compare skill levels and based on those you find out what your difficulty number is that you need to roll on the dice.  The number of dice you roll is based on your power level.  So, you roll and try and hit the difficulty number, each difficulty you hit is a wound to the unit.  Get enough wounds, and the unit dies.  But before it dies, and every time it is hit, they get a counterstrike against you.  Also combat is limited to 7 rounds.  If at the end of the 7 rounds the attacker hasn't won, they lose.Combat ends and the winner (if it wasn't by default) gains points for each creature they kill.  At different point levels the Titan is stronger, you can summon angels arch angels, and more.  Don't get me wrong, there is a LOT of stuff to this game, a lot of things to remember...there is also a lot of strategy of whether to move, or not move, or how to block people, or run away or how to divide stacks, etc...But there is so much random to this game that I can't help but put it on the same level as Risk.  It just bores me after a while.  Even if you have a killer strategy, if the dice don't go your way you won't ever win.  I don't mind some luck, or some random, but this game requires it for determining terrain destination (which effects which units you can have), actual combat, and where you start on the board.  The game has some interesting quirks to it, and I think I gave it so many tries specifically because of how fun the mechanics could be, but at the end I ran out of interest due to all the dice rolling and the way things were set up.  The same happened to me in Risk back in the day as well.This game isn't for everyone, but if you don't mind so much randomness you're all set, and the mechanics take it miles past Risk in that regard.But, for me, it would never be a game I played often.  And please understand there is no way I could fit all the different rules and mechanics and everything in this review.  There are a lot of different things that happen as the game goes.

For an interesting read, google ""Steve Jackson"" and ""Secret Service"" at the same time.)  The original Munchkin series was a satiric take on hack-and-slash roleplaying; Munchkin Bites takes on the vampire and goth genres.  Gameplay itself is fairly simple.  Players start with a hand of four cards from which they may select character classes and/or equipment.  Each class has its own strengths and weaknesses, but the weaknesses tend to disappear during gameplay as players simply become more and more powerful.  Gameplay consists of drawing a card, fighting the revealed monster or dealing with the effects of a non-monster card, and trying to scoop up treasure.  The goal?  Gain 10 (or 20, if you prefer) levels.Munchkin Bites is a stand alone game, but it can be combined with any of the Munchkin series, including the expansions.  It's not a particularly complex game; the fun comes from arguing about helping or hurting other players in their quest for levels.In addition, the cards themselves are satirical looks at the vampire and goth roleplaying genres.  Curses such as ""The Universe Hates You, Lose 1 Level"" pop up, as do humorous takes on monsters and magic.Munchkin Bites is a decent game, and I can recommend it as a simple but fun family game.

Each turn has many different components, and usually includes all the different elements of the monster as well, such as drawing its card, digging out its standie, rolling for it's color (which generates a card draw for that color's player) rolling for it's combat bonus, etc. A turn can have several of these monster-generation/combat sequences, and also includes searches, flee attempts, various card draws for treasure if monsters are defeated or searches are successful... a single turn can take 20 minutes.  And it's not 'fun' time...it's a lot of basically doing little fiddly things and trying to remember intricate sequences of actions you're supposed to do. Then, after all that, you still have to do the 'monster move' before the next person takes their turn.The overall effect is like a video game that's been translated wholesale into a board game, with no thought given to the reality...in a video game, the computer keeps track of all the tedious stuff for you, such as your level, your hit points, your movement allotments, the monsters levels and hitpoints and movements, and on and on.

Well...there's a reason we have DMs.  They make the game much more fun for everyone else.I gave this game 2 stars for the high quality of the game components and for my suspicion that if a group of adult gamers who were already Munchkin fans were playing, it might be more fun than my experience of trying to play it as a family game.

One of my friends bought this game and its expansion.  We've played it a few times now and I have to say, I just don't like it as much as the card games.  It's a good concept, but a few glaring problems make it far less fun in my opinion.Pros:-Well made.  Everything feels like a good quality piece.  Everything you need is there and it doesn't feel like it's going to fall apart on you.-Rules are similar enough to the card game that anybody with experience with the cards will pick up this version very quickly.-Simple, and mostly intuitive, rules.  And if you make a small mistake it won't ruin everybody's experience.Cons:-Individual turns can be time consuming.  If one person has ways of making extra moves beyond the base three then that turn can take forever.  This is especially true if they don't stop to loot rooms and just fight monster after monster after monster while laying down more and more tiles that nobody else is going to bother entering because there's no longer anything there to fight.  This is a real problem because...-...there is far less player interaction in the board game than there is in the card game.  Unless you are next to a person there are only so many things you can do to another player.  This makes it more like each individual playing their own game and seeing who can win first, rather than everybody playing a single boardgame.  For example, I've played in a game where a player went from level six to level 10 and won the game in a single turn. The whole time they were going through the motions to do this there were no actions anybody else could take and nobody could stop them.  It was four people sitting around for ten minutes while one person got to play and then it was over.  Not fun.I really wanted to like this game.  It just doesn't play as smoothly as the card games and I think it is less fun due to the longer time between turns and the decreased player interactions.",3.0,Potential mired by a few big issues,1288742400,"11 3, 2010",Toys_and_Games,0,love Munchkin card game   gaming group different genre game   friend buy game expansion   play time like card game   good concept glare problem far fun opinion pros:-well   feel like good quality piece   need feel like go fall apart you.-rules similar card game anybody experience card pick version quickly.-simple intuitive rule   small mistake will ruin everybody experience Cons:-Individual turn time consume   person way make extra move base turn forever   especially true stop loot room fight monster monster monster lay tile go bother enter long fight   real problem far player interaction board game card game   person thing player   make like individual play game see win everybody play single boardgame   example play game player go level level 10 win game single turn time go motion action anybody stop   people sit minute person get play   fun want like game   play smoothly card game think fun long time turn decrease player interaction

It's not the most fun or strategically intense, but it plays quickly and provides endless amounts of trash talk.  Most of these kids play 'Halo' or 'Call of Duty' regularly, so having a board game where you can get body armor, cheat hacks, and a flamethrower you can attach to a rocket launcher is pretty cool.You choose the starting stats for your combatant by dividing 7 points among attributes for speed, health, and accuracy.  Then you roll the dice to run around the board and blast your opponents to smithereens.  There's a LOT of dice-rolling involved, and therefore luck plays a large factor in everything.  Sometimes you just can't get the roll you need for a new weapon or gadget, and even when you do, the card you draw might be totally useless for your situation.  This is not a game for strategy purists.When you get fragged you lose your weapons and armor, but you always respawn on your next turn, so you're never out of it.  This also means that other players can jump in at any time and start blasting away, which is good if you're burning time until everyone shows up to play some other game.  It's especially gratifying when you respawn right behind the player who just fragged you, take them out with your starter pistol, and scamper off with the dropped plasma rifle they fragged you with only a minute before.Quality components, dry-erase stat cards, and a BIG two-sided board are excellent upgrades from the original version, making it more fun to look at and play.

Can't say enough about how much fun the overall game is.  Awesome. I can't, unfortunately, repeat that word for Munchkin 6: Demented Dungeons.  You won't hear me repeat the word again in this review.This Munchkin expansion introduces two new card types to the game: Dungeons and Portals.  Dungeons are cards that are played in a separate stack from the normal two stacks in a typical Munchkin game (the Door stack and the Treasure stack).  A Dungeon card represents the dungeon the characters are playing in.  There is a Dungeon in play at all times, and each dungeon adds a new rule or new law by which the characters must abide while that dungeon is still in play.Portal cards get dealt into the Door stack, and they're used to change out the dungeon that is currently in play and replace it with a new one.  Some Portal cards have their own rules, so that two or three dungeon cards can conceivably be in play at the same time.All this sounds great, and it is in theory.  The problem is that there aren't many Portal cards, and when you have a lot of expansion decks in play, that makes for a lot of Door cards.  When you have to shuffle the Portal cards into the Door deck, they get diluted significantly in a bigger deck.  A big part of the fun with the Dungeon element is to regularly change out the Dungeon (and some of the rules for specific dungeons are less fun than others to live with, so you WANT those changed out quickly).  A big deck of cards means you may only encounter a new Portal every once in a while (or occasionally not at all).  This leaves you with two options.1)  Deal the Portal cards into the whole big Door deck and hope for the best, knowing that you may not see a Portal card again for most of the game and may get stuck with a Dungeon you don't much care for.2)  After you shuffle the whole big deck of Door cards, shuffle the Portal cards into just the top [insert your favorite fraction here] part of the Door cards.  Top half, top third, maybe?  This way the Portal cards are mixed in relatively close to the top and are sure to be drawn often throughout the game.  The problem with this is that, if you want to continue to do this, you have to go through the deck after every game and pull out all the Portal cards so that they can be shuffled into the top portion of the deck for the next game.  Otherwise, they'll be all mixed in after the first time you do this.Option 1 is not much fun when you have 500+ Door cards diluting the handful of Portal cards.  Option 2 is a royal pain to deal with before and after every game (but it's great during the game.)If you're working with a smaller deck (my condolences), this may not be such a big deal.  After playing with these cards a few times, though, we just leave them in the box now.  Not really worth it.  In the immortal words of Dennis Miller, though, that's just my opinion; I could be wrong.Munchkin 6 is still good, just not quite as aweso--",3.0,Not quite as awesome as other Munchkin decks,1300752000,"03 22, 2011",Toys_and_Games,0,mention Munchkin review awesome Munchkin     great game fun overall game   awesome unfortunately repeat word Munchkin 6 demented Dungeons   will hear repeat word review Munchkin expansion introduce new card type game dungeon portal   dungeon card play separate stack normal stack typical Munchkin game Door stack Treasure stack   Dungeon card represent dungeon character play   Dungeon play time dungeon add new rule new law character abide dungeon play portal card deal Door stack change dungeon currently play replace new   Portal card rule dungeon card conceivably play time sound great theory   problem portal card lot expansion deck play make lot Door card   shuffle Portal card Door deck dilute significantly big deck   big fun Dungeon element regularly change Dungeon rule specific dungeon fun live want change quickly   big deck card mean encounter new Portal occasionally   leave options.1   Deal Portal card big Door deck hope good know portal card game stick Dungeon care for.2   shuffle big deck Door card shuffle Portal card insert favorite fraction Door card   half maybe   way Portal card mix relatively close sure draw game   problem want continue deck game pull Portal card shuffle portion deck game   mixed time option 1 fun 500 + door card dilute handful portal card   option 2 royal pain deal game great game.)if work small deck condolence big deal   play card time leave box   worth   immortal word Dennis Miller opinion wrong Munchkin 6 good aweso--

{'$oid': '5a13282c741a2384e879d3d4'},A3KM6UZ6QPKBAK,1572810173,hippie,"[4, 7]","I have to admit that unlike some other reviewers, I actually admired the deck's variety in covering many different Tolkien texts (though, of course, the deck name does imply a LOTR-exclusive tarot).  However, I don't necessarily think they did a good job with that.  But I liked to see the range of the material.  I would like a better, overall Tolkien deck in general.The review I most agree with is from TarotPassages, by Kim Huggens--it's basically right-on.My favourite things:When the cards line up tarot and Tolkien accurately, they do an absolutely splendid job.  A good portion of the Major Arcana reflects this: most specifically, cards like The Sun (the Shire in bloom), The Hermit (Tom Bombadil, which I thought was very clever), The Chariot (Theoden gathering his disparate forces in his final charge of the Orc Army), The Tower (Orthanc under attack by the Ents), Temperance (Frodo's mercy on Gollum), Death (Gandalf versus the Balrog), Justice (the Dead Men of Dunharrow, come to atone for past promises), and the Devil (as Wormtongue--though as many have pointed out, of course, The One Ring would have been a MUCH better choice--but still, I thought Wormtongue was unexpected and inventive).  Seven of Cups as the illusions created by the palantiri I thought was creative.Yet there are still many, many problems.  For instance, The Sun references the Shire as being ""where everything is growing in harmony""--and yet, in the picture, only the grass is growing.  There is no green on the trees, which look like they are in the heart of winter.  This is not the image of the Sun, or of the blooming Shire.  The theme of AWFUL illustrations is recurring, too.  The majority of the images featuring trees show leafless, bare branches, that are dark and craggy.Eowyn slaying the Nazgul Chief, as the Queen of Swords, is also a good idea--but she is scantily clad in a flowing gown that reveals quite a lot of bussom and an entire leg.  May I remind the artist that Eowyn was cross-dressed as a man.  Please and thank you.  Furthermore, why should Eowyn have to be scantily-clad at all?  She can be properly dressed and still be dangerous.  I'm sick of this idea that women can only being a force to be reckoned with if they're exposed physically.In general, the artwork is clumsy and small, and rather ""wide"" / square feeling, which I was disappointed with.  Plus, again, the images (especially of nature) are quite dead.  It's rather ugly.I would like to comment on the shallow, negative perception of the Hierophant, who reaaaaally really really should be Gandalf (the teacher, the bridger of two worlds--as the Intro in the Little White Book actually explains).  Instead, it is Saruman of Many Colours: a rather dark and evil take on the Hierophant that I think is undeserved and inaccurate.The World and The Star I also thought were rather shallowly done (as Kim Huggens described).  The World is...quite simply, Middle Earth, which I don't actually see as embodying any of the qualities the World card is meant to describe.  It is quite literal and flat.  The Star is Galadriel and her Ring.  I had deeply hoped it would be Varda, the Goddess / Queen of the Stars (also known as Elbereth / Gilthoniel).  Furthermore, there is little meaning to Galadriel's Ring being the Star--again, simply another direct, literal association.I also did not understand why The White Tree, bridging two worlds, constituted Strength.  Why would that be Strength?So, finally, the art is atrocious, the meanings don't always match, and even when the meanings aren't outright wrong...they're still not outright correct.  It's okay for doing readings--I use mine and find the cards friendly.  Lots of the ideas are also GREAT! and really illuminate cards and situations.  It's just, there aren't enough of those (as in, the whole deck should make sense).  I just think the technical details (and art) need a lot of work, but this isn't a totally deplorable deck.  There was obviously a lot of effort here, and there are certainly redeeming qualities.  I also quite liked the little descriptions at the bottom of the cards--I thought they gave an extra meaning to the rather average / generic Little White Book meanings (which were not explicitly related back to Tolkien / the cards at all).So: bottom line, they're okay, but not great, and they really should be great.
