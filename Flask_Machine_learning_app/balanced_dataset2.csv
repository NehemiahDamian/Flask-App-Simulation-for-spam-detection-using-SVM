The older grandchildren haven't tried this yet--they are too far away. This game uses a lot of brain power if you want to win, especially when you are first figuring it out. The scoring could not be done easily by 10 years old unless they had a fair amount of help at first.I like this game because there is a lot of strategy and as the board changes, you must adjust.If you like Rummy-cube, you might like this, but it is harder.I don't like that my 17 year old beats me!!",5.0,Fun game for ages 10+,1296086400,"01 27, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1,buy new toy house include game toy puzzle grandchild infant 10 17 year old son husband old grandchild try far away game use lot brain power want win especially figure scoring easily 10 year old fair help like game lot strategy board change adjust like rummy cube like hard like 17 year old beat

So, please excuse me if you read it twice (but, I thought I'd include it here as well since I didn't know where folks would start).De-Ranged is a 112 card expansion for the Fantasy Munchkin theme. It contains 60 door cards and 52 treasure cards. It does not introduce any new races, but it does introduce a new class: Ranger... bringing total number of races to 6. You don't need a ton of expansions to get the most out of the base game, but the base game and least two are definitely worthwhile investment.As noted in my other reviews, I own all of the Fantasy Munchkin expansions, and if I were to recommend an order to get the most new variety for your dollar, this one would be near the bottom of the list (still worthwhile, but there are several that I'd get before this one). Instead, I would suggest Munchkin Clerical Errors as it adds a race and a class, followed by Munchkin 8 Half Horse, Will Travel Card Game as it adds two races and three race/class enhancers, followed by the ones that are most interesting to you after that.",4.0,A worthwhile (though not the best) Fantasy Munchkin expansion,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1,originally write review forMunchkin 5 derange   excuse read twice think include know folk start).de ranged 112 card expansion Fantasy Munchkin theme contain 60 door card 52 treasure card introduce new race introduce new class ranger bring total number race 6 need ton expansion base game base game definitely worthwhile investment note review Fantasy Munchkin expansion recommend order new variety dollar near list worthwhile instead suggest Munchkin Clerical error add race class follow Munchkin 8 Half horse Travel card Game add race race class enhancer follow one interesting

It's ridiculously overproduced in the best way - 192 miniatures, dials, a ton of cards, a million chits. This is one of those games that's large and in charge, like spreading out an entire fantasy world before you.The one negative that I wanted to mention is the game's packaging - while it's clearly intended to be presented as an enormous, epic box of insanity, the entire game could easily be packaged (even before being punched out and assembled) in a box about half the size of the one that it comes in. For gamers that already have a closet (or spare bedroom) full of games, it's tough to make room for such a big package that's just plain unnecessary. It is covered with beautiful art, so that's one thing it has going for it, but the entire game can easily be boxed up in something significantly smaller for transport. The other thing is that after punching out all of the chits and pieces, there's about as much laminated cardboard left over as has been punched out in the first place; I don't even recycle, but even I felt environmental guilt at how much excess was left over to be tossed (to be fair, they did include recycle symbols on all of the extraneous pieces).Outstanding war game that only gets better on subsequent plays.",5.0,"Packaging aside, an outstanding game",1269475200,"03 25, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,customer review cover need say game incredibly fun engrossing spite epic 3 + hour affair time fly lot downtime player ridiculously overproduce good way 192 miniature dial ton card million chit game large charge like spread entire fantasy world negative want mention game packaging clearly intend present enormous epic box insanity entire game easily package punch assemble box half size come gamer closet spare bedroom game tough room big package plain unnecessary cover beautiful art thing go entire game easily box significantly small transport thing punch chit piece laminated cardboard leave punch place recycle feel environmental guilt excess leave toss fair include recycle symbol extraneous pieces).outstande war game get well subsequent play

We've enjoyed the original Fluxx for years and it served as a tutorial for this game since this one is more in-depth. For example, many of the Keepers have abilities in this game. For intance, The Captain can steal a crew member once per turn if it is in front of another player. The crew members each have abilities of their own, such as the Scientist stealing Unseen Force (which allows you to take a random card from an opponent's hand once per turn) and the Doctor cures the Creeper Brain Parasites if attached to one of your Keepers. You can therefore play combos that turn the tide of the game quickly. It still has the ever-changing Fluxx feel to it..Brain Transference allows you to switch positions with an opponent so the underdog can gain the advantage.

As per the usual rotation of expansions, this one is a smaller one without an extra board. However, the impact this expansion can have on your game of Arkham is quite significant. Whether you wish to make the game easier, harder, or some of both, this expansion has it all. Here are some highlights:*Revised Gate Tokens - These new gates make one of the core components of game play (the opening of gates and your attempts to shut them down) much more dynamic. There are gates that devour the investigator they open on immediately, gates that spawn monsters if you fail to close them, gates that move with the monsters (and cannot be sealed if they move), endless gates that can never be collected as gate trophies, and several more. As you can tell, these new types of gates make the game much more challenging. There is one helpful gate - a forked gate that allows you to choose which other world you go into and allows you to remove two types of monster from the board when you close it. However, the difficulty of closing it is much higher.*New Herald: The Lurker - This is one of the more fun heralds to play with. It allows you to make deals with the devil, so to speak, that help you a lot in the short term. In the long term, however, the Lurker collects on his debts by forcing the investigators that bargained with it to make some very cruel decisions between bad and worse.*Relationship Cards - These can be very helpful and can make the difference between winning and losing the game at times. This is probably my favorite new element, as it adds an extra story element to the game even as it affects game play. Ever wonder why these random investigators know each other? Now you can find out by drawing your relationship card! Investigators get bonuses from their relationships. As such, this is one way of making the game easier if you wish to dial down the difficulty.*New Spells - I really like these, actually. There are some very helpful spells for closing gates. They clearly fit the theme of adding new, more difficult to close gates. Of course, if you stick to the classic gates, these spells might make some games easier, but that hasn't bothered me at all. Generally, unless you get something that allows you to pick the exact spell you want, the odds of these coming up in a larger deck of spells are low enough that the game can still be quite challenging.The Verdict: This is one expansion that is well worth buying. It balances the more difficult additions with some very helpful additions. Even those who prefer a more vanilla game of Arkham Horror without the extra expansions and boards will likely find themselves incorporating the relationship cards and wondering how they ever played without such a great addition.",5.0,Great expansion for a great game,1285718400,"09 29, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,good rounded expansion Arkham Horror game usual rotation expansion small extra board impact expansion game Arkham significant wish game easy hard expansion highlights:*Revised Gate Tokens new gate core component game play opening gate attempt shut dynamic gate devour investigator open immediately gate spawn monster fail close gate monster seal endless gate collect gate trophy tell new type gate game challenging helpful gate forked gate allow choose world allow remove type monster board close difficulty close higher.*new herald Lurker fun herald play allow deal devil speak help lot short term long term Lurker collect debt force investigator bargain cruel decision bad worse.*relationship card helpful difference win lose game time probably favorite new element add extra story element game affect game play wonder random investigator know find draw relationship card investigator bonus relationship way make game easy wish dial difficulty.*new spell like actually helpful spell closing gate clearly fit theme add new difficult close gate course stick classic gate spell game easy bother generally allow pick exact spell want odd come large deck spell low game challenging verdict expansion worth buying balance difficult addition helpful addition prefer vanilla game Arkham Horror extra expansion board likely find incorporate relationship card wonder play great addition

On your turn you pick an Adventure card to go to and roll a bunch of dice to try to complete the card.PROS:1. Many people are calling this ""Arkham Horror Light"" and as a PRO of this game I'd say it delivers on the theme.  The flavor text on the cards is entertaining and the art is top-notch.  The components are great, like all Fantasy Flight games.2. You can play this game in about an hour, unless you have a lot of players (more than 4)3. The rules are super-easy to learn and you can be playing this game in about 20 minutes.4. The game is fun, but I don't know how replayable it is.5. Very portable and takes less space to play than a lot of games.CONS:1. It really comes down to a lot of dice rolling and I felt like I was playing Yahtzee.  In games like Arkahm Horror you have a lot more decisions to make that I feel affect the game, and yes there is still dice-rolling, but I have a greater sense that my choices affect my success more than I do in this game.2. I kinda like having the same characters from Arkham Horror and Mansions of Madness, but after a while I wonder if they're just recycling them to save money.  How about some new characters and new art???I do have to admit there's a trade off -- you get less depth than Arkham Horror, but you can play it in 1/3 the time, with 1/3 the space and 1/10th the amount of little plastic baggies.UPDATE: 4/19/2013I just thought I'd mention that I still pull this game out from time to time and that says a lot, since I've had it for a year and a half.  In fact, I upgraded it from my original rating of 3-stars to 4-stars for this reason.  Above all else, the game is fun, and it is perfect for those times when you don't have enough time to set up/play/put away a more involved boardgame.

Although I prefer the fat packs (see link at bottom), or the boxes with nine packs, a d20 and about 100 lands, they run at about 40 dollars apiece and have less cards in them.  As I had already spent about 60 bucks on fat packs this month (Showcase Comics had a GREAT Valentines sale), I was left with a substantially less amount of disposable moolah.  I saw this, and after reading the reviews, decided to buy it.  I mentioned before how I spent about 60 dollars on fat packs, right?  Well, this box might have surpassed them in the value of cards.  I got a planeswalker, the newest, which is Sorin.  He sells for more than the toolkit is worth.  He is of the highest rarity, as are two other cards I obtained in this pack (Tree of Redemption and primordial hydra).  Overall, I am pleased to the upmost degree with this toolkit, and I've just wasted your time (whoever is reading this) where you could have purchased this toolkit.  Oh and shipping from gohastings was the same day, given the fact that I ordered it late the night before.  It shipped within 24 hours, and got to my door two days before it was due to arrive, which means it was delivered from Arizona to my house in Pennsylvania in five days, including the weekend and President's day, which further narrows my case by two days, as post is not delivered on holidays or Sundays.  So, instead of reading the last sentences of what seems to be a college essay, which is what I really should be working on seeing that it's due in a mere 7 hours, order the toolkit instead.

Originally, I was browsing for gifts for my little sisters and came across this, and asked them if they'd be interested. When they declined, I decided to ask for it for myself, after watching a few videos of it. Now that I've been flying it around the house all day, my sisters are incredibly jealous and each want their own. LOL! Go figure.As for the product itself, it is very durable and easy to control. We've already had a few crashes, and it seems to be holding up just fine. The body itself is metal, and the blades are plastic. This is definitely a good thing, in case you run into a TV or delicate object laying around the house. It is incredibly stable to fly, and easy to maneuver around the house, away from pets, over obstacles, etc. We had a lot of family over and they were impressed how stable it is, and how easy it is to make it hover, land, etc.My only real qualm is the battery. So far, I've gotten about 6-7 minutes of solid flight time out of a 40 minute charge. That's not bad, and the battery charges a bit faster if you use an A/C USB adapter (such as an iPhone charger adapter) as opposed to a computer port. It would be nice to have a little more battery life for each run, but given the size of this thing, and the price, I'm not taking off any stars for that.Overall, a great gift for anyone. I'm 22 and I love it. My uncle is in his 50's and he wants one now. Educational value? Your kids will learn a lot about air currents if they end up flying it around the house a lot.

Once we adjusted to the scant rulebook in CR (it was very alarming to make up house rules when we were new to the genre), we found the game to be fun and engaging, and it made sense to try out the second version.  WoA shows some obvious improvements over CR.  We found that the health and monsters are balanced better, though it's hard to put my finger on exactly what changed to make it so.  However, in CR, we basically always had to add a house rule for possible health drops after defeating an enemy (we would roll the D20 to determine whether health would or would not drop and then again for how much).  In WoA, we don't have to do that, and we still win often enough to make the game fun and not just punishment.Now that we have played real D&D;, this game feels a little bit weaker.  I see now the depth that I'm missing here, and it's true that actual role playing is hard.  However, I don't think it's fair to blame this game for being watered down D&D.;  In fact, I think it's basically marketed to be that way.  By and large, we don't have time for a full D&D; campaign with weekly meetings that last for hours at a time.  When those sessions happen, they are more fun than playing WoA or CR, but they don't happen very often.  In the mean time, this provides the opportunity to use all of that magnificent dungeon-crawling lingo and to experience the agony of peaking around a dark corner and finding a cave bear waiting for you.Overall, I would say that, in many ways, this is a strategy game couched in the slick skin of an RPG.  My husband and I like to work hard to optimize our plans and order our strategies to have the best run-through.  When we play the game with a full party of friends, much chaos and laughter ensue (because, let's face it, five turns per round produce a LOT of monsters and encounter cards).  Yes, we have had to implement house rules occasionally, but the game is still solid even in its original form.  This is a great family game if your family is the right kind of nerdy.  We've played D&D; on the computer (Neverwinter Nights), which was a lot of fun.  But, board games are better at bringing people together.  We can play this in a few hours with another couple and enjoy an evening entirely without screens.  I find that to be a benefit.Oh, and if you need more incentive to buy this game, you can always view it as an investment in another new hobby.  We have taken up painting minis after buying these games, and we have found that the painted figures bring so much more depth to the experience.",4.0,A Solid Experience for D&D Light,1378598400,"09 8, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,game Castle Ravenloft   adjust scant rulebook CR alarming house rule new genre find game fun engaging sense try second version   WoA show obvious improvement CR   find health monster balance well hard finger exactly change   CR basically add house rule possible health drop defeat enemy roll D20 determine health drop   WoA win game fun punishment play real d&d game feel little bit weak   depth miss true actual role playing hard   think fair blame game water D&D.   fact think basically market way   large time d&d campaign weekly meeting hour time   session happen fun play WoA CR happen   mean time provide opportunity use magnificent dungeon crawl lingo experience agony peak dark corner find cave bear wait overall way strategy game couch slick skin rpg   husband like work hard optimize plan order strategy good run   play game party friend chaos laughter ensue let face turn round produce lot monster encounter card   yes implement house rule occasionally game solid original form   great family game family right kind nerdy   play D&D computer Neverwinter Nights lot fun   board game well bring people   play hour couple enjoy evening entirely screen   find benefit oh need incentive buy game view investment new hobby   take paint mini buy game find paint figure bring depth experience

That stereotypical ""gimme your lunch money!"" interaction never happened to me (we all had free lunch growing up in the Cleveland Public School system), but I've definitely had more than my fair share of scuffles. Lunch Money is a game that simulates that unforgettable experience of a playground brawl.A fight simulating card game? Really!? Yes, and Atlas Games does a good job of it. Lunch Money is a game for two or more players, I find that it plays best with at least three people --but a one on one brawl is just as fun, every game ends that way. The Objective of the game is to take your opponents' life counters down from 15 to 0. A player who runs out of counters is unconscious and out of the game. The last player standing wins!The game play is a standard shuffle up and deal. Each player gets 5 cards and within their hand they have options to defend, attack or heal themselves. A typical turn revolves around choosing another player to attack, pairing cards into combos or meeting play requirements (some cards you have to have a grab card to play or some defense cards can only defend certain types of attacks) and the player you chose figuring out the best way to defend themselves. There are a wide range of basic attack cards, defense cards, weapon cards, and specialty cards. Some of my favorites: ""Humiliation"" can be played at any time, at any point, on any player's turn to humiliate the player and ruin their strategy. The concept behind the card is that the player describes a sequence of events that will humiliate to the point that they are so ashamed that whatever they were trying to do fails. There's also ""Pimp Slap"", ""Poke in the Eye"", ""Spinning Backfist"", weapons like ""Chain"", ""Pipe"", ""Knife"", and ""Hammer"".The greatest draw of this game is the artwork and witty card types and phrases. For example, the flavor text on ""Humiliation"" reads ""Jesus hates you; and so do I"". Another great one is ""Chain"", it reads ""What's black and blue and red all over? You are, silly!"". The images on the cards are eerie (photos by Andrew Yates). A little girl posed in threatening positions, ready to pounce on a would be defender. The photos are artistically shot, often out of focus in strategic areas to add effect, high contrast with dense blacks and washed out highlights. The mood is truly set through the imagery on the cards.Lunch Money won the Origins Award for Best Card Game of 1996 (tied with three other games). Its a great game for non-gamers and strategic enough for hardcore players. One thing I don't normally embrace with tabletop gaming is household rules, Lunch Money lends itself to creating household rules that can enhance the experience. Table talk is one of the most enjoyable parts of this game, its even in the rule book--""Colorful banter is an important part of Lunch Money, so dont be afraid to get into the game by describing in vivid detail the insults you perform upon your opponents. Don't be surprised by the imaginative things they do to you in return, and remember:its just a game.""",5.0,The Gamer Nerd Review: Lunch Money,1364342400,"03 27, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,"review image view Gamer Nerd Dot comgrowe sketchy moment playground recess stereotypical gimme lunch money interaction happen free lunch grow Cleveland Public School system definitely fair share scuffle lunch Money game simulate unforgettable experience playground brawl fight simulate card game yes Atlas Games good job lunch money game player find play well people --but brawl fun game end way objective game opponent life counter 15 0 player run counter unconscious game player stand wins!The game play standard shuffle deal player get 5 card hand option defend attack heal typical turn revolve choose player attack pair card combo meeting play requirement card grab card play defense card defend certain type attack player choose figure good way defend wide range basic attack card defense card weapon card specialty card favorite humiliation play time point player turn humiliate player ruin strategy concept card player describe sequence event humiliate point ashamed try fail Pimp Slap poke Eye Spinning Backfist weapon like chain Pipe Knife hammer"" great draw game artwork witty card type phrase example flavor text humiliation read Jesus hate great chain read black blue red silly image card eerie photo Andrew Yates little girl pose threatening position ready pounce defender photo artistically shoot focus strategic area add effect high contrast dense black wash highlight mood truly set imagery card lunch Money win Origins Award Best Card Game 1996 tie game great game non gamer strategic hardcore player thing normally embrace tabletop gaming household rule Lunch Money lend create household rule enhance experience table talk enjoyable part game rule book--""colorful banter important Lunch Money not afraid game describe vivid detail insult perform opponent surprise imaginative thing return remember game"

Some people like this, and others this bothers.  Perhaps a bit like Settlers of Catan in this respect. Since certain characters (like the King) have distinct benefits, they also tend to be the ones most commonly targeted by some of the other characters, and if somebody really likes playing the King it could seem personal.

Think ""The Addams Family"" meets ""Magic: The Gathering."" In Gloom, the goal of the game is to make the characters in your family suffer tragedies, while attempting to bring fortune and happiness to your opponents.  Then you kill off your characters at their lowest point.  The player who's family suffers the most wins.This is all done with macabre humor.  So people who are easily offended, card carrying members of the humorless society, small children, and opossums should avoid this game.Although you can play Gloom strictly as card game, avoiding any of the story telling, you can't experience Gloom's full fun potential this way.  It's like having a sundae without any syrup, whipped cream, or a cherry.The rules of the game are straight forward, and anyone who picks up this game should be ready to play within a couple of minutes.  That said, there is layer upon layer of strategy while playing, and you have multiple elements to keep track of when you play a single card.  This makes Gloom one of those games that's easy to learn, difficult to master.  The cards themselves are a unique game element.  Multiple cards are be played on top a character card, but because the cards are transparent, modifiers from previously played cards either show through or are obscured by the top card.The artwork on the cards is great, and their transparency combines to make the cards eye candy -- it's just fun to look at them.  The only nit is that the writing is a bit small.  If you're farsighted, prepare to wear your glasses while playing.All in all, played with the story telling element, Gloom will keep you entertained and laughing.

The designers likely planned for this, as the game has separate rulebooks for simple and advanced play. For reference, I think Settlers of Catan is good introductory boardgame for 3-4 players, and another excellent game for a large crowd would be Apples to Apples.The ideal range for this game is 5-8, with 9-10 possible if you encourage players to start moving their race car immediately (instead of finger counting 3-4 different possible routes). Also, with more players, blocking and slip streaming become more relevant and add a nice (still intuitive) tactical layer.For beginners, I recommend skipping the ""Collision"" and ""Great vs Bad Start"" rules (which slow the game down without much payout). In their place, I recommend adding the ""Slipstream"" and ""Nitro"" rules.Pros:- Best with 5-8. Plays 9-10. This is really hard to do with a board game. Typically only card games like Apples to Apples or social games like The Resistance can hit these numbers well.- Very intuitive, you can explain the rules in a few minutes.- Gear box playing pieces are fantastic.- The game actually feels like a racing game, with racers often neck and neck.- It's very easy to catch up in this game. Usually a winner can only be known for sure at the last turn.Cons:- The biggest disadvantage is that you can find better boardgames for 2-4 players. If you're new to the hobby, you should buy depending on your average expected group size, which is (typically) not 7-10.- Some of the advanced damage rules need frequent referencing, a one page reference sheet would've been useful (e.g. Hand-braking wears out brakes up to 3, at which point it starts wearing out tires).- I wish I had a second pair of each dice and a better token for Nitro.- I wish I could use the custom characters with the basic game.",5.0,Best intro game for 6+ players,1377388800,"08 25, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,good introductory boardgame large crowd designer likely plan game separate rulebook simple advanced play reference think Settlers Catan good introductory boardgame 3 4 player excellent game large crowd Apples Apples ideal range game 5 8 9 10 possible encourage player start move race car immediately instead finger count 3 4 different possible route player block slip streaming relevant add nice intuitive tactical layer beginner recommend skip Collision great vs bad Start rule slow game payout place recommend add Slipstream Nitro rule Pros:- Best 5 8 play 9 10 hard board game typically card game like Apples Apples social game like Resistance hit number well.- intuitive explain rule minutes.- Gear box play piece fantastic.- game actually feel like racing game racer neck neck.- easy catch game usually winner know sure turn Cons:- big disadvantage find well boardgame 2 4 player new hobby buy depend average expect group size typically 7 10.- advanced damage rule need frequent referencing page reference sheet useful e.g. Hand braking wear brake 3 point start wear tires).- wish second pair dice well token Nitro.- wish use custom character basic game

{'$oid': '5a13282c741a2384e879f6be'},ANMN28JDZHANV,1880992760,Aaron Zirkelbach,"[17, 17]","Everway is another forgotten game, a casualty of trying to bring innovation to the mainstream market (I could say it was something else, but I'd be lying).  Produced by Wizards of the Coast before they bought TSR/D&D;, Everway was meant to be a joining of CCG and RPGers.  WotC basically wanted a RPG line that produced as much money as a CCG line (everyone knows this is impossible.  Not even D&D; brings in Magic: the Gathering money).  So, in short, CCGers and RPGers wanted nothing to do with it, because CCGers and RPGers are completely different types of gamers.And for RPGers, I think this was a mistake of dismissing a book by it's cover.Everway is a city in the game, a city with a diverse history and culture.  Everway is the place where the Walker's Pyramid lay, waiting to be finished.  The Walker was a deity of some sort that could step between spheres (dimensions, worlds, etc), and everywhere he stepped, a portal was opened to that sphere.  These portals couldn't be walked through by every random peasant, though.  A spiritually dense type of people - called Spherewalkers - could make the trip like walking in between two rooms.  These people walked all paths of life, from mighty wizards to lowly rat catchers, completely without defining marks or auras.  The player's characters are all automatically Spherewalkers, and experienced ones at that.Everway is called ""Visionary Roleplaying"" for good reason: it's chargen method, which is really it's claim to fame as far as I am concerned.  The game comes with 90 Vision cards, which are simply art cards, which are used in conjunction with a Q&A; round to help define a character's background and personality.  For example, someone picks a card that looks like a woman dancing in the street.  Then everyone takes turns asking questions about the picture, such as ""Who is she?"", ""Why is she dancing?"", ""What town is this"", etc.  You actually don't need the cards, any art will do, but it's nice to see them included in the set.On to the numbers:  Characters get 20 points to divide up into their four attributes: Air, Earth, Fire, Water.  Or perhaps I should call them Mind, Body, Speed, Soul, because basically that's what they are.  It's a good attribute spread, the same that Unknown Armies used later on.  Anyway, a player determines character's abilities by putting points in them.  Average human is 3, best possible for characters looks to be 10.  The traits are exponential, meaning that someone with Earth 4 is twice as strong as someone with Earth 3, and four times as strong as someone with Earth 2.Every character also has four specialties, one for each element, which effectively adds 1 to his element score in situations where the specialty applies.  So if someone with Fire 4 had the specialty Swordsmanship, whenever he was swordfighting, his Fire would be considered a 5.If a player elects to not spend all his attribute points, he can place them in Powers and Magic.  Every Everway character gets a free Power (besides Spherewalking) as a quirk, a little flair for the character.Powers are pretty straightforward: powers that normal people don't have, like waterbreathing or poison immunity.  Some of those 20 attribute points can be spent for Powers, which cost 1-3 points, depending on if it's frequent, major, and/or versatile.  The free Power mentioned above can't be frequent, major, or versatile.  There are many examples, but I won't spoil the rules here beyond what I've already said.Magic is altogether a different beast, and probably the only strike I see against the system.  To tell the truth, it is entirely too vaguely defined and handwavey to really be a useful addition to the rules, and personally I would handle magic in the same way Powers are dealt with, above.Task Resolution: The game's effects resolve through three methods, which the author calls Kharma, Drama, and Fortune.  Now, these aren't meant to always be used exclusively.  They can often be combined by the GM.Kharma: Kharma is pretty simple, whoever has a higher number in the relative element being tested is the winner.  So if one character is swordfighting another, they compare Fires (obviously taking into account any relevant specialties).  The higher one is the winner.Drama: Drama basically dictates that whatever is best for the plot should happen.  If the villian is supposed to get away, it is so.  If the heroes are supposed to slay the dragon, it is so.Fortune: Fortune is the randomizor of the game, as much as dice are to most other RPGs.  It comes in the form of 36 tarot-like cards, which also have meanings when drawn reversed.  So the deck has 72 possible results.  These cards are interpreted by the GM, who explains how they effect the situation.  If (for instance) the Nature (Life Energy) card is drawn in a swordfight, the participant most in tune with nature would most likely be the interpreted as winner.I'll end this review with a full product description.

The goal of the game is to identify and capture the enemy leader, while preventing the enemy from doing the same to you.At the beginning of the game, each player is secretly dealt a character card which gives them a team affiliation and a rank.  Each player reveals the team symbol in the lower right hand corner of their card to the player on their left.  Each round the active player attacks another player, forcing them or a player who chooses to intervene to suffer a wound - which means revealing one of three pieces of hidden information on the top of their character card.  If a player reveals their character's rank via an attack, they get to use the special ability corresponding to that rank (such as healing another player's wound, dealing direct damage to another player, or even looking at another player's character card). The player who took the wound then becomes the active player and play continues until one character suffers four wounds and is &#34;captured.&#34;  When any character is captured, everyone's character cards are revealed and (under the default rules) if the active player captured the lowest rank enemy player then the active player's team wins.The good:*  It was easy to learn.  People picked up on the basics right away and the game plays fast enough that even when a mistake was made, it didn't have lasting impact on the evening.*  There are more roles & abilities than most of the other &#34;traitor&#34; games.  I think everyone likes having something special to do instead of being a &#34;plain villager.&#34;*  There are plenty of opportunities for bluffing, deduction, and backstabbing - which is, after all, why we play these types of games.  For example, some character cards initially appear to be on the other team (the symbol in the lower corner that they reveal at the beginning of the game isn't their real team), some cards don't reveal their team color when attacked (they draw a &#34;?&#34; token rather than their color when wounded), and players can of course pretend to be something they're not up to the point that they're forced to reveal via wounds.*  The end result is a nice, quick, &#34;light&#34; social game.  Not to say there isn't depth to the game, but rather that it wasn't as intense as some of the other games (we had noise complaints in the past over some Resistance-fueled shouting).The bad:*  Some of the rules could be clearer or better laid out in the manual.  We ran into a couple of ambiguities that could have been easily dealt with.*  Deciding who to attack can seem a bit random early in the game when there isn't much public information.  This isn't anything new for people who've played other social deduction games (and at least there isn't player elimination), but some of the newer players seemed put off initially.*  Deciding who to capture can seem a bit random at the end of the game.  Because players often aren't sure who their own team leader is, it's hard for the other team to deduce much from their behavior. More often than not, by the time it's clear what the teams are, it just becomes a race to take down the most likely leader even if the odds aren't much better than 50/50.The ugly:*  The art. The designers went with a photorealistic over-the-top goth look which I heard described as glamour shots of people who take Vampire LARPing very seriously.  It isn't a huge deal personally, especially since players only glance at their cards a couple of times during a game, but there are clearly people on the internets with big feelings about it.  I know this because when I tried to find a clarification of one of the rules (see above) on the official message boards, every active thread was someone complaining about the art.Summy:Overall, I like it and it went over well with my gaming group.

Some dungeons add bad things (-1 to run away, everyone changes sex, any curse that is drawn or played is applied to everyone, etc.), and others add good things (increased hand size, extra treasure, everyone gets a class or race, etc.). The included Portal cards are a clever way to work this in the game (you randomly insert the portal cards into the encounter deck, and whenever you flip one over you change dungeons).

""A Journey to Rhosgobel"" concentrates on the theme in that both the quest and many of the player cards are Eagle-related. One of the best facets of the LCG is thematic situations and play, and AJTR scores well in that area.In the quest, the Great Eagle Wilyador has been wounded in a battle with trolls, and the players are tasked with taking him to Rhosgobel to be healed by the wizard Radagast. Wilyador's wounds worsen with each turn, acting as a sort of timer. Along the way the players, will need to collect sufficient quantities of the healing herb Athelas to cure the Eagle's wounds by the final phase of the quest.  Timing this can be a bit tricky.In addition to the quest, Eagles can work well in the players' decks for dealing with the numerous quest-specific `Mirkwood Flock' and `Black Forest Bats' creature cards.  These flying enemies aren't too tough, but can only be blocked or attacked by characters with the ranged ability or Eagle characters.Of the player cards, both of the Tactics cards relate to Eagles and include a unique Eagles character, Landroval.  Radagast, the game's second Istari, is a neutral card. He has a willpower of 2 and unlike the Core set's Gandalf, he sticks around once played, so he can help with questing.  Radagast also collects a resource a turn that can be spent on creature cards or to heal creatures, so he's a perfect fit for the AP's quest, as well as a great addition to any Eagles deck. The pack's hero, Prince Imrahil, is a quite capable leadership character who readies when a character leaves play, but not particularly attuned to the quest.  Also notable are the Spirit cards ""Escort from Edoras"", that serves as a nice, one-shot quest booster, and ""Ancient Mathom"" which adds some card draw to the Spirit sphere.The quest in AJTR is somewhat innovative and I like the rescue storyline and Eagles theme.

In that regard, I was not disappointed.Battle Cry is what is commonly called a 'light wargame'.  The game comes with multiple scenarios, each one based off of historical battles from the Civil War.  Thanks to the different terrain tiles, each battle presents its own set of advantages, disadvantages and challenges for each side.  This means that the game has a fairly high replay value, which is good for something that costs nearly fifty dollars.  Another thing I like about the game is that a single battle is usually finished within an hour.  Although some people might find this a disadvantage, I've found that my shelf has far too many games that, while fun, are almost never used because finding an entire afternoon to devote to them is difficult.Of course, the game is not without its flaws.  The rules are fairly simple and easy to grasp, but this does reduce the amount of strategic options.  Furthermore, while the commands and colors system is usually excellent, it can at times be frustrating when the battle boils down to who had the right cards at the right time.  Being the first game to utilize the system, it lacks some of the depth that Memoir '44 has.

Even absolute first timers will get the hang of it during the very first couple of minutes. It's not fast, nor particularly agile, but it will not do anything weird during flight, and is as steady as a rock. Some heli's are to touchy, or not consistantly responsive but not the S107. It does exactly what you want it to.Charging does take awhile, about 45-50 minutes, with a flight time of around 7-10 min. I have used the USB cord, but I prefer the Syma wall charger I bought. Charging from the remote takes a very long time, about 1 1/2 hour, and kills your 6 AA batteries after only a few charges, so don't do it!Parts, both replacement, and upgraded are readily available.

Every component has detailed artwork that does not disappoint.  The player mats are a bit flimsy and the game uses the standard colored cubes for resources.Rules Clarity - 9/10The rulebook is filled with photos and examples to aid in understanding.  Constantinopolis comes with one of the best-writted rulebooks I've seen.  The rules are extensive, though, and you may have trouble finding a specific rule if you need to look something up during gameplay.Gameplay - 7/10Every player essentially goes broke in the first turn.  The obvious strategy at the beginning is to purchase buildings that allow you to produce more goods.  Beyond that, there are a couple of options you can play:- You can establish a market trade engine so that you activate your buildings to sell goods and earn points,- You can buy ships so that you can always ship your goods and earn all the points and money from your commerce cards,- You can purchase Wall segments to earn in-game bonuses and end-game points,- Or you can do any combination of the above.Every strategy will work, but only one person will win!The only luck involved comes with the commerce cards you draw.  If you receive commerce cards that match your resources, you'll earn more points and more money, which will let you buy more resource production.  The luck fades out into strategy later in the game as you purchase the buildings and ships needed to fulfill your commerce contracts no matter what you're dealt.Player Interaction - 6/10Constantinopolis has minimal player interaction.  The first phase of each turn is an Auction for public office in which players bid for turn order and turn ability.  After that, the player acting as Consul may interrupt your building purchases during the Construction phase or another player may purchase the last ship that you needed during the Accept Contracts phase.  The limited supply on buildings and ships is the only way to hinder your opponents' strategies, so not much cut-through action here.Replay Value - 7/10Within the last two turns of the game I was starting to feel that the game had gone on long enough.  I played with experienced players and our game took us about 2.5 hours to complete.  I don't foresee strategy changing much from game to game.  You may buy buildings in a different order, but not much is going to change.Distinction - 6/10While this game is fun, there are plenty of games that are very similar.  The games Cuba and Puerto Rico, for example, have almost all of the same game mechanics.  In terms of uniqueness, this game may be more familiar than foreign to first-time players.Scoring - 8/10The scores remained quite low for the first half of the game until everyone was producing the resources needed to start mass shipments of goods.  Each contract can earn you 1, 2, or 3 points depending on how you ship your goods.  The shipping mechanic is very well conceived in my opinion.  You will ask yourself if you want the quick points and money or if you should wait an additional turn to gain an additional point or two.SummaryVisual Appeal - 9/10Rules Clarity - 9/10Gameplay - 7/10Player Interaction - 6/10Replay Value - 7/10Distinction - 6/10Scoring - 8/10RATING: 7.4I definitely recommend this game!",4.0,"First Impressions, a positive review",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1,"Impressions positive reviewvisual Appeal 9/10The component game beautifully design   component detailed artwork disappoint   player mat bit flimsy game use standard colored cube resource rule Clarity 9/10The rulebook fill photo example aid understanding   Constantinopolis come well writte rulebook see   rule extensive trouble find specific rule need look gameplay gameplay 7/10Every player essentially go broke turn   obvious strategy beginning purchase building allow produce good   couple option play:- establish market trade engine activate building sell good earn points,- buy ship ship good earn point money commerce cards,- purchase Wall segment earn game bonus end game points,- combination strategy work person win!the luck involve come commerce card draw   receive commerce card match resource earn point money let buy resource production   luck fade strategy later game purchase building ship need fulfill commerce contract matter deal player Interaction 6/10Constantinopolis minimal player interaction   phase turn auction public office player bid turn order turn ability   player act Consul interrupt building purchase Construction phase player purchase ship need Accept Contracts phase   limited supply building ship way hinder opponent strategy cut action replay value 7/10within turn game start feel game go long   play experienced player game take 2.5 hour complete   foresee strategy change game game   buy building different order go change distinction 6/10While game fun plenty game similar   game Cuba Puerto Rico example game mechanic   term uniqueness game familiar foreign time player scoring 8/10the score remain low half game produce resource need start mass shipment good   contract earn 1 2 3 point depend ship good   shipping mechanic conceive opinion   ask want quick point money wait additional turn gain additional point SummaryVisual Appeal 9/10rules Clarity 9/10gameplay 7/10player interaction 6/10replay Value 7/10distinction 6/10score 8/10rating 7.4i definitely recommend game"

Miller,"[34, 34]","Although I didn't purchase this from Amazon, I do own the product.Pros:- Nice looking pre-painted 15mm miniatures- Quick setup- Easy to learn- Games can be played in 60 minutes or less- Many free downloadable maps and scenarios both from Avalon Hill and the user community- Expandable via map and booster packs so game play never gets staleCons:- The starter set includes more Allied pieces than Axis, giving the Allies a significant advantage- Most of the downloadable scenarios cannot be played with just the starter pack units- Booster packs are expensive for the number of units you get ($11 to $15 dollars for five miniatures)Being new to Axis & Allies, this seemed like it would be great little game and I am not disappointed. Whereas the board games are more strategic, this is more tactical which I like. In addition, games can be played in around 60 minutes as opposed to 2 to 5 hours for some Axis & Allies board games. It comes with 10 detailed 15mm miniatures, each having a corresponding card that shows its cost, year available, defense, speed, weapons range and any special abilities it may have as well as a little trivia about the unit. The starter pack comes with the following miniatures:Axis:- German Panzer III Ausf. F (Tank)- German MG 42 machine-gun team (Soldier)- German PanzerFaust 30 (Soldier, anti-tank)- German Mauser Kar 98k (Soldier, rifle)Allies:- British Cromwell IV (Tank)- Russian T34/76 (Tank)- U.S. M4A1 Sherman (Tank)- U.S. ""Red Devil"" Captain (Soldier)- U.S. Bazooka (Soldier anti-tank)- U.S. M1 Garand Rifle (Soldier)Also included in the box are:RulebookQuick start guideEight dice (six sided)Damage countersTwo double-sided maps that may be used separately, or be combined to form six different configurationsThe starter pack does not come with any scenarios probably due to the limited number of units. The rulebook simply recommends you setup some skirmishes using the units included in the box. This will help you learn the rules and flow of the game. There are a ton of downloadable maps and scenarios from the Wizards of the Coast website ([...]) but most I have looked at require more units than the ones included in the starter pack and this is where the game can get expensive. To get the most out of this game (as in any collectible miniature or card game) you need to purchase booster packs. You can buy booster packs from eight different sets, each set containing from 48 to 60+ miniatures. Each booster pack contains five random miniatures from that set. At about $11 - $15 a pop, you can see how this would add up quickly. The good news is that there are websites out there that sell the individual units from each set. Although some of the rare units can be upwards of $10 to $11 apiece.Overall Axis & Allies Miniatures is a fun game to play if you like unit level tactical combat. As long as you are prepared to make about a $50 to $60 investment beyond the starter pack price, you can have a game of almost infinite re-playability with collectible miniatures to boot.

A game lasts between 30 and 60 minutes.You will draw and play train cards in order to build routes connecting cities on your route cards.  Each turn you decide if you want to draw more train cards, play your cards to connect two cities (before someone else takes the route, but be careful that you don't give them the opportunity to block you), or draw more route cards (gaining points if you complete the route, or losing points if you are unable to do so before the end of the game).I prefer playing with 4-5 players, as there is more direct competition, trying to work around the trains that others have placed.  2-3 players is fun as well, but with 2 players, it sometimes turns into a game where each player is playing on their own side of the board with little interaction.For 2-3 players, I prefer theTicket To Ride: Nordic Countriesand the Switzerland (now included withTicket To Ride India: Map Collection - Volume 2) expansion maps.",5.0,Great board game for 4-5 players.

Difficult in the capacity you can gamble everything on a dice roll so you have to do some conditional probability to assess risks instead of just hoping for a good roll. You can make more decisions about what gets saved, rolled, re-rolled, when to gamble it all or close on a good position.

It was refreshingly easy to learn how to play but the more times we play it, the more difficult the strategy becomes.  The strategy also changes depending on how many people are playing the game.

MCCRACKEN,"[6, 7]","I have several E flight helicopters so I thought I would compare this to the blade micro line--the blade MCX2 compares to this one in terms of size but there are some major differences.--The blade MCX2 RTF goes for $120, this one goes for under $30.--The Blade MCX2 uses a four channel 2.4 Ghz DSM radio which offers more maneuverability and more range. It is also bindable to other radios in the DSM2 line. The Syma uses an infrared 3 channel radio. Infrared needs to be in the line of sight, has much less range and can suffer from interference from bright light and other sources. The MCX2 uses a nearly foolproof radio system.--Both the MCX2 and the Syma vary the speed of the motors to control the directional rotation (yaw).--The MCX2 uses a swash-plate to vary the pitch of the lower roter, thus giving you the ability to move left/right/forward/backward; the Syma uses a small up/down tail motor to change the pitch of the helicopter and propel it forward or backward. You cannot really move it left or right, but you can turn the helicopter right and move it forward.--The Blade MCX2 uses a replaceable 120mAh 14C single-cell 3.7V LiPo battery--the Syma also uses a 3.7V Lipo, although to get to it you have to remove the canopy which requires a very small screwdriver. This isn't a big deal, but it means that you can only fly it for 5-8 minutes then you have to recharge it. With the MCX2 you can simply switch out the battery and keep flying. Your flight time is limited only by the number of spare batteries you have with the blade MCX2.--The syma is built like a tank--and this is probably the most surprising thing--although it is much less expensive it seems to be over-engineered, at least in terms of its main body. That said, it isn't really much of an advantage because the MCX2 is so light that even if you slam it into a wall it usually just bounces off with no damage. The Syma does the same thing, of course, but the extra weight of the metal frame (vs. plastic in the MCX2) certainly contributes to shorter flight times.There are some other differences as well but I think you get the idea. The Syma packs an incredible amount of technology into a box for $30...you can't really beat it for that price. If you are a tinkerer I bet you could modify the canopy and make the battery quickly changeable...buy some extra batteries and fly indefinitely. This is great for younger kids as the controls are scaled down and very controllable. I bought this one for my 7 year old nephew and it is perfect for him. I'd place this one somewhere between a hobby grade helicopter and a toy. If you are looking for more maneuverability and possibly buying other helicopters in the future you might want to go with blade...but the price on this one is so good you really can't go wrong.",5.0,Great value compared to the Eflight lineup,1287100800,"10 15, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,e flight helicopter think compare blade micro line blade MCX2 compare term size major differences.--The blade MCX2 RTF go $ 120 go $ 30.--The Blade MCX2 use channel 2.4 Ghz DSM radio offer maneuverability range bindable radio DSM2 line Syma use infrared 3 channel radio Infrared need line sight range suffer interference bright light source MCX2 use nearly foolproof radio system.--Both MCX2 Syma vary speed motor control directional rotation yaw).--The MCX2 use swash plate vary pitch low roter give ability leave right forward backward Syma use small tail motor change pitch helicopter propel forward backward leave right turn helicopter right forward.--the Blade MCX2 use replaceable 120mah 14c single cell 3.7v LiPo battery Syma use 3.7v Lipo remove canopy require small screwdriver big deal mean fly 5 8 minute recharge MCX2 simply switch battery fly flight time limit number spare battery blade MCX2.--The syma build like tank probably surprising thing expensive engineer term main body say advantage MCX2 light slam wall usually bounce damage Syma thing course extra weight metal frame vs. plastic MCX2 certainly contribute short flight time difference think idea Syma pack incredible technology box $ 30 beat price tinkerer bet modify canopy battery quickly changeable buy extra battery fly indefinitely great young kid control scale controllable buy 7 year old nephew perfect place hobby grade helicopter toy look maneuverability possibly buy helicopter future want blade price good wrong

You accumulate victory points chiefly by completing quests, to which you must commit substantial resources. Your turns are spent in acquiring the resources via agents who visit certain locations. The mechanic that dictates that only one agent may claim a site's resource creates tension as you wait impatiently for your turn. The selection of quests is key to your success - but the quests are also a first-come, first-served resource, so there is tension in deciding whether to first grab the choice quest, or try to acquire scarce resources that can be used for any of the quests that you do pick up.I rated this only 4 stars solely because of the components and packaging. The odd shapes of the markers are very fiddly to align so that they will fit into the formed tray. You're perhaps better advised to pitch the sorting tray and keep the markers in baggies.

Lorenzi,"[5, 7]","Wow were to start, Its a great concept and well thought of system, but it takes to dang long.First of all you get enough skill cards for 3 players. You get enough dice for 1 person so you'll have to be passing the dice around a lot. Make sure you but 2 or 3 more dice sets it will speed things up. I bought 3 more sets and now we can accommodate for 3/4 people.If you didn't buy the creature vault your missing out on the cheat cards, but you can make your own just write all the creature stats on a index card that way you don't have to jump around in the book. Also you only get a hand full of creatures with the core set.When I said it takes to dang long I really mean it. Let me explain: We had a fight with 6 regular humans vs our 4 RP. It took an hour and a half to complete the combat.1. Everyone rolls for initiative. I have a agility of (5) so I roll 5 stat dice d8, but depending on my stance I get to convert X amount of stat dice into stance dice. Say I'm 2 into conservative stance. so I roll 2 green conservative dice and 3 blue stat dice. I count the number of successes (hammers). That tells me were I stand on the initiative list. Everyone does the same.2. Now that the initiative list is done for both players and enemies the highest initiative side goes first. When it comes to RP's they get to choose who goes first in the group. Witch kind of makes it pointless having a high agility to begin with.3. There is no grid. The rangers are ext-ream, far, mid, and near. You can only attract someone that's near you unless your using range. The weapon table will tell you the range of the weapon. It takes 1 moreover to move between ranges. If you wish to move more than one say from far to near it will cost you your one free moreover and you'll suffer one fatigue to preform the other moreover.4. Action, you have some predefined action cards that show you what actions you can use. You can buy more actions at the character creation stage. Some actions for example are melee strike, strike to stun, shield bash, back stab ... You can only preform one action during your turn. Some actions have special bonuses that you can preform if the dice roll in your favor. Some actions have penalties that make your roll more challenging but rewarding at the same time. Ok, say I want to attack a bum that standing in front of me. I declare melee strike and now I build my dice pool. Since I'm using a sword I use my strength stat to determine how man stat dice (blue) to use. I have a strength of 4 so I get 4 blue dice. But I'm 2 into conservative stance so now i replace 2 of the blue dice with green conservative dice. I have weapon skill for swords so I had a yellow skill dice, I 1 fortune point in my strength so i add 1 fortune dice. Now my target has a toughness of 3 and my strength is 4 so the attack is fairly easy so I add 1 challenge dice to the pool. But the bum is actually wearing studded leather under his rags so he has a defense of 1 and that adds 1 misfortune dice to the pool as well. The bum also sees me coming and will preform a dodge action so that adds another misfortune dice to the pool, hell let say the ground is wet and slippery, that'll add another misfortune dice to the pool. Tada!2 blue dice2 green dice1 yellow dice1 white dice1 purple dice3 black diceAfter rolling all that out and seeing what cancels what you can determine if you successively hit the target. You have to end up with at least 1 success (hammer) now if you succeeded and had some left over symbols like 2 boons your action card tells you what additional bonuses you get. 2 boons would of got me +1 to my damage.Now the damage. I was using a short sword that has a weapon damage of 5 and my strength is 4 so my damage is now 9 plus i get a bonus from the 2 boons so now its 10. The target has a 3 toughness and his leather armor has a soak of 1 and his total damage reduction is 4 I only hit the target for 5 damage.Now that was just 1 person moving and attacking imagine doing that for the 4 RP's and the 6 enemies. Now you can see why it takes so long. The more dice and more familiar you are with the rules and dice the faster it get's but its still a giant pain in the arse.Fun game none the less, but if you've played 1st or 2nd edition you might feel this system is a bit over complicated and drawn out.Hope that little example helped you out. I didn't have the action cards in front of me so who knows if 2 boons gets you a +1 to damage.

I consider this par for the course and no promise of any faster service was offered, so this is just what I'd call average fulfillment speed, but slower than I'm used to with Amazon.  Everything else about the purchase was flawless.The game is also as advertised.  Dominion with a dungeon delving theme.  It is a bit slow to setup, particularly the Dungeon Hall, and the instructions are rather poorly written.  The game itself is quite fun and seems to be reasonably well balanced.  It's very clear the maker plans multiple expansion sets and some of the abilities are less useful than others, likely waiting for said expansions.For those who do not know Dominion, it's a deck building game where you start out with a small number of cards in your deck.  You start with cards in your hand drawn from your starting deck, use them to purchase new cards (which go into your discard pile), then discard your hand and all the played cards at the end of your turn, drawing a new hand.  When you run out of cards in your deck, you shuffle your discard pile and it becomes your deck, complete with the new cards you've acquired in prior turns.  The strategy is in controlling the mix of different card types so that each draw has the highest chance of helping you acquire the cards you need to win.Thunderstone adds the mild complexity of letting the player go to the dungeon or the village each turn.  In the village, you hire, train, and equip the heroes that form the core of your deck.  In the village, most cards have a cash value that let's you buy new cards, and you can also ""spend"" experience point cards (gained fighting in the dungeon) to ""level up"" your heroes.  In the dungeon, you face monsters and need to have a certain amount of light and combat power to defeat each one.  Defeated monsters are added to the victors deck and are the primary cards worth victory points at the end of the game.Overall, I enjoy the game, though its design is not quite as elegant as Dominon.",4.0,"Thunderstone, Dominion Meets D&D",1269302400,"03 23, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,purchase game Amazon affiliate receive day expect primarily processing delay   consider par course promise fast service offer average fulfillment speed slow Amazon   purchase flawless game advertise   Dominion dungeon delve theme   bit slow setup particularly Dungeon Hall instruction poorly write   game fun reasonably balanced   clear maker plan multiple expansion set ability useful likely wait say expansion know Dominion deck building game start small number card deck   start card hand draw starting deck use purchase new card discard pile discard hand play card end turn draw new hand   run card deck shuffle discard pile deck complete new card acquire prior turn   strategy control mix different card type draw high chance help acquire card need win Thunderstone add mild complexity let player dungeon village turn   village hire train equip hero form core deck   village card cash value let buy new card spend experience point card gain fighting dungeon level hero   dungeon face monster need certain light combat power defeat   defeat monster add victor deck primary card worth victory point end game overall enjoy game design elegant Dominon

Dragons are awesome... the world needs more dragon games, especially ones where you get to be the dragon! Any game that uses hexagons makes a good first impression with me. This game was simple enough to learn and enjoy the first time playing (unlike some games that have encyclopedia's of rules and stats that are overwhelming). This game does it right: enough numbers and rules for good control and variability, but not so much you need to study the game.The angled blocks are a clever way of showing banks, sharp turns, dives, power dives, etc. I love all the dice rolling (all 1d10's) but I still feel in control (i.e. the game outcome is not entirely random because of using dice). It's fun to pilot your dragon around the map, trying to get the best angle and range on the others. I look forward to the success and expansion of this game, especially to getting some dragon figurines. In it's current version, the dragons are card stock paper boxes printed on all sides.I like the points system and the ability to create your own dragon. I look forward to designing a dragon with the attributes that fit my personality and play style best. The game comes with pre-made dragons, so for now I'm getting to know them.I recommend this game for someone who likes directly player-versus-player combat games. It's got enough rules to make the game variable and interesting.

My expectations were further diminished when I first handled the remote control, which felt poorly and cheaply constructed. However, all of my preconceptions vanished the second I fired up the S107 for the fist time. This thing is amazing!The truth is, the remote control is not of the highest quality, but it gets the job done and, at the price, who can complain? The helicopter itself is constructed with amazing precision and is more durable than one might imagine.Beyond construction, and more importantly, this thing flies like a dream! I did have to adjust the trim ever so slightly, but, now that it is dialed in, it will hover so motionlessly that it looks like it is hanging from the ceiling on a wire. While there is a minor learning curve, it should not take anyone more than ten minutes or so to be flying this little gem like a pro; and the freedom provided through the multidirectional controls will have just about anyone feeling like a pro in no time.As great as it is, the S107 is definitely an indoor flyer. In fact, one might even want to make sure that their air conditioner is turned off to avoid any unexpected gusts which can make the S107 a little more challenging to control. Once the basic controls are hammered down, however, a little flowing air can provide an extra element of fun.The blades on this bad boy do get moving, so it is not a terrible idea to wear some eye protection; although, when used properly, there is not a tremendous risk of bodily harm.I am hooked.

The cards fell into place and the planets aligned; I managed to gather a group of would-be adventurers willing to take on the universe.  Starting with Teemo the Hutt.My gaming group consisted of myself two of my children and two nephews.  All under the age of 11, so they did receive a little extra help from the GM to get started, this being their first P&P; RPG as well.  I did the introductions for everyone to censor a few things and add some humor, as well as speed up the process to keep everyone's attention on the matter at hand.  By the time we finished the second encounter (Cantina) everyone had a good grasp of the mechanics. Most of them knew what dice to roll, what the symbols meant, and just how cool rolling a Triumph to defeat the last ""pig-guy"" through the eyes of a 10 year old really was.  Bedtime cut the game short at that point to much protest. First thing this morning the game was still being talked about and re-enacted as if they had a watched a movie of what had happened.  Very cool to see the little minds and their imagination at work.  I asked my daughter if we were going to play tonight and was shocked to hear ""no"" in response.  As my look of bewilderment set in, she said ""before night, so we can play longer.""Long story short...  Myself and my group of new RPers were able to follow along with the Adventure Guide efficiently enough to hold the attention of 4 very active children, and learn the basic rule set so far.  I have read ahead being the GM and wanting to know what to censor slightly for this younger group and do not foresee any comprehension problems as they continue their attempt to escape Mos Shuuta, and Teemo the Hutt's grasp.I will be picking up the core rule-book and GM kit as I have convinced a few friends to give it a shot as well.*********************************************4 Stars for Durability and Educational Value:Durability - While the character sheets, maps, tokens and dice are very good quality the packaging is flimsy and will not withstand much re-boxing of everything included.Educational Value - While the game isn't teaching kids Rocket Surgery or Quantum Physics, it is introducing young minds to critical thinking and is an exercise in imagination for everyone.5 Stars Overall and Fun:Overall - This is an introduction to the game and while I would have liked for it to have come in a more durable box, for $20something dollars there is enough inside the box that makes me overlook the packaging.  Great Value and convinced me to purchase the core product.Fun - My wife had to come in from the other room to video tape (haha showing how old I am here... *record*) the festivities, as laughter and excitement permeated through the entire house while we were playing.  I would have given 6 stars for fun based on having one of the better family nights in a while.

Every aspect of the book assists the would-be players and game masters in telling the greatest story possible.

So do not compare it to a 30 dollar RPG book, because if you are counting words/mechanics, the WFRP3 supplement will lose. You will also gain, at minimum, two insanity effects (see what I did there?.)That being said, here are my impressions of the product.Good :* Interesting careers, with new mechanics for some. For example, the swordmaster and ironbreaker have career specific items that they come with. Like the trappings of old. Also, the rat catcher has a very compelling mechanic with the small but vicious dog. Should have they been included in the original set? Sure. But not everything is going to fit in one release, either.* Action cards. There are some really neat new cards, esp. for melee oriented careers, along with more intelligence based ones. In addition, there are more duplicates of commonly used cards.* The rest of the cards. All good stuff as I can tell. Nothing seems amazingly under/over powered.Bad :* No Halflings. Bummer. Perhaps FFG cannot find a way to make them mechanically viable.* I personally do not care for more cardboard chits and the like. I would have preferred more cards. Or Hobbits.* Not really a bad, but I would like to have some kind of clue what will appear in the future, as far as upcoming WFRP3 releases go.Bottom line : You should get this if you like what WFRP3 has to offer.

First off, I love this game. I rarely take time to review anything. In this case, I have seen a number of reviewers who were a little harsh based on their expectations. So, I wanted to add my two cents.What is Castle Ravenloft? This game is not the D&D; most people are used to. D&D; lite is a pretty good way of describing it and that's what I love about it. Castle Ravenloft is a much more accessible form of D&D; for geeks and nongeeks alike. It's like some other reviewers have mentioned, it's a great game to sit down and play for an hour or two and is simple enough for people who have never touched this kind of stuff to pick up and learn pretty quickly. The best way to play this game is have a few beers, joke around about how screwed you are (the game is actually very difficult, especially if your Dragonborn fighter can't seem to kill anything), and just roll with it.There really isn't any role playing involved (unless your gaming crew decides to add it in). It's all about the D20 combat system (based around 4th edition rules) and quite a bit of luck as well. You slowly reveal the dungeon, battle monsters, get treasure, and work on accomplishing whatever goal you have to to win the game. It's a relatively quick and fun way to get into the D&D; universe without having to commit hours and hours like you would with a normal D&D; adventure.There are a couple of other things worth mentioning. For the price, you get quite a few miniatures. They aren't painted, but they would still make excellent figures for a DM to use in a regular campaign. If you're into painting, there isn't anything stopping you from painting them as well. The artwork and quality of the pieces is fantastic. The board, tokens, and most of the figures are sturdy and with proper care, should last a long time.Why didn't I give it a perfect score?-I would have liked to see more monster variety. Although, you can mix the contents of this D&D; board game with the two others that are out to give you more variety of monsters and heroes.-There are a few figures that are a bit flimsy and could easily be broken if you don't store it right or you allow younger children to play.Overall, the game is well worth the price and I promise you if you go into it with a few friends, an open mind, and not expecting a full fledged D&D; session, you will have a lot of fun with this!",4.0,Go in with an open mind and you'll have a great time!,1399161600,"05 4, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1,25 year old geek plenty experience card game tabletop game rpg love game rarely time review case see number reviewer little harsh base expectation want add cent Castle Ravenloft game d&d people d&d lite pretty good way describe love Castle Ravenloft accessible form d&d geek nongeek alike like reviewer mention great game sit play hour simple people touch kind stuff pick learn pretty quickly good way play game beer joke screw game actually difficult especially Dragonborn fighter kill roll role playing involve gaming crew decide add D20 combat system base 4th edition rule bit luck slowly reveal dungeon battle monster treasure work accomplish goal win game relatively quick fun way d&d universe have commit hour hour like normal d&d adventure couple thing worth mention price miniature paint excellent figure DM use regular campaign painting stop paint artwork quality piece fantastic board token figure sturdy proper care long time perfect score?-i like monster variety mix content D&D board game variety monster heroes.-there figure bit flimsy easily break store right allow young child play overall game worth price promise friend open mind expect fledge D&D session lot fun

This card adds intense drama to the Alternative Ending selection, the one card that can make all of your conquests and adventures pointless.  You pass the Valley of Fire, and instead of a rich reward you instantly die, suddenly giving every other character a fighting chance.So I was thrilled when ""Talisman: The Blood Moon"" finally introduced the Horrible Black Void back into the game. Excellent.But that is one card. How is the rest of the set?  It's pretty good.  Like most of the small expansion sets, this has a new theme, a new game mechanic, a few new characters, and a smattering of new Adventure and Spell cards.  The theme for this pack is Night/Day, with a Night/Day counter that flips at certain times, and brings new time-related effects.  Also introduced is The Werewolf, a beast that stocks the board likeThe Reaper, moving anytime a character rolls a ""1"" for movement.The Werewolf is probably the most significant addition (aside from the Void!).  That is non-card dependent, and comes into play based on a die role.  I'm not sure if I like the Reaper and the Werewolf moving on the same die role; it means a role of a ""1"" becomes a long turn as you resolve both characters.  My game group experimented with moving the Reaper on a ""1"" and the Werewolf on a ""6,"" which was good but gave us yet another game mechanic to keep track of.Which is also the problem with the Night/Day card.  If you are like me and buy all of the available ""Talisman"" expansions, then you have a stack of Adventure cards that reaches the ceiling.  The odds of anyone drawing those specific Night/Day affected cards are pretty slim, so that effect almost never comes into play, except for characters affected by Lycanthrope.  Card combos are rare in ""Talisman,"" due to the sheer volume of cards.  If designers want to introduce a new mechanic, they need to have something with a general effect, not dependent on specific card draws.Also, with all of the expansions you can have a glut of game mechanics.  If you play with ""The Blood Moon"" andThe Dragon, then you have to do all of this upkeep every turn, which takes away from actual playing time.I like the new characters in this set. The Vampire Hunter, The Grave Robber, and the Doomsayer.  They have decent abilities  that mainly have to do with card draws.  There are a few new cards that help you wipe the board clean, which is really useful.  A long game generally leaves the board covered in cards. Some of the cards in this expansion I know I won't play with.  There is an Alternative Ending called The Lightbringer that turns the game into a cooperative board game, with all players working together to reach the Crown of Command before a certain term limit. It isn't a bad idea, but I don't really want to play cooperative ""Talisman!""Ultimately, ""The Blood Moon"" is just a little tide-me-over until the real next expansion arrives, ""Talisman: The City.""

I was a huge fan and even collected some of the game supplements. I played it for many years until WE no longer owned the licensed and it was purchased by WOTC (who produce Magic the Gathering CCG). I perused their version of SW (Saga Edition) and while it was graphically nice it did not grab me. For one thing it felt and looked like D&D 4th edition engine given the trappings of SW. I even played it and it was not the same as the experience of playing WE games SW. Fast foward and my friend shows me Fantasy Flight games (FFG) Edge of Empire RPG book. The book was huge, and the artwork was stunning. I thought at first this was put out by Lucasfilm, the production values were simply amazing. But reading the fine print It was FFG who put it out. I remember FFG because they are the company that re-released Talisman the board game and Warhammer Fantasy RPG (a gorgeous book and a complete system). I went to barnes and noble and got a cup of coffee and read this book some more. I was hooked. I was reading Edge of the Empire and imagining stories and characters of my creation coming to life in the SW universe again. The new dice mechanics were a bit intimidating, but after reading the dice mechanics I realized that FFG did this for a reason: they did not want this game to be a number crunching game like so many other table top rpgs are. It was so simple and elegant and did not detract from the spirit of being in the SW universe. The characters were fringers and scoundrels, not heroic Jedi (and I love Jedi, but this character will be given full treatment by FFG in 2015).  I could play in a group of characters that were surviving on the Outer Rim worlds, bounty hunters, assassins, diplomats. Wow. The possiblities this book offers are vast. I decided to pick up the book (on amazon, of course because it sold for 30% discount). I even picked up the Edge of the Empire Beginner Box set to get the dice and tokens, maps and other intro stories so I can run it for my group.  I even joined FFG's forums so I can stay on top of the latest news and just discovered that the next core rules: Age of Rebellion, is out later this summer and which covers playing characters who have joined the rebellion against the Empire. So to summarize (and becuase other reviewers here do a better job of breaking down the contents of the book) I love this new game and I am excited that a game company has captured the feel and wonder of playing the SW universe like West End games did.

I have played a lot of Arkham Horror and Last Night on Earth The Zombie Game but I enjoy A Touch of Evil more. These other games are both fun but I think A Touch of Evil better captures the fun and flavor of a horror adventure game, dripping with theme and atmosphere. Arkham is best appreciated by those familiar with H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos and Last Night can be too one-sided if you are the Heroes instead of the Zombies. Where A Touch of Evil really shines over Arkham is that the Minions are all tailored specially to the Villain, not a random monster mash that doesn't make any sense. Another big plus over Arkham and Last Night is you can play it solo, competitive, cooperative or competitive teams whereas Arkam is only cooperative and Last Night on Earth is competitive teams (heroes vs. zombies). Various ""use what you like"" add-on rules are provided to increase the challenge (particularly important for cooperative mode which is way too easy to win unless you use the Cooperative Mystery Chart to throw more challenges at the Heroes).Play time averages 2-3 hours once you learn the rules and it supports up to 8 players (although having a large number of players is probably best served by playing as competitive teams).There are a bunch of cool Heroes to play. Some are balanced while others are better at one skill or another (Combat, Cunning, Honor, Luck, or Spirit). You use your stats to fight monsters and to pass skill tests. Heroes take their turns moving and encountering different creepy locations and then the Villain gets his turn in the Mystery Phase, where really bad things can happen! The villain might send his evil minions to ambush the heroes, or cause horrible events, or even appear and try to murder one of the Heroes! Basically, you deal with the Villain's evil deeds as best you can (negating some when you can), while traveling around the village map collecting investigation (used as money to shop for items or activate certain items or abilities) while trying to beef up your Hero's items and skills enough before challenging the Villain to a showdown in his (randomly determined) lair. To assist you in your final battle, you can recruit up to two of the village Town Elders into your hunting party. The problem is, they all have (randomly determined) secrets, some of which can make them run away or even turn evil and switch sides to aid the villain! You can (and should) investigate the Elders' secrets before you attempt to recruit them; this costs investigation but more secrets can be added throughout the game. Just to be clear, there is no villain player; the players are all playing against the game (like Arkham Horror).The female Heroes include a corrupt noblewoman, beautiful outlaw, and determined schoolteacher. The male Heroes include a cunning police inspector, battle-hardened soldier, mysterious drifter, and hideous, scar-faced courier. The villains include the Werewolf, Spectral (Headless) Horseman, Vampire, and Scarecrow, each served by various evil minions and events. You can get two more ""official"" villains free online from Flying Frog (the rather nasty Delion Dryad and the Christmas-themed Volgovian Nutcracker). Other fan-made villains like Frankenstein's Monster, a Haunted House, The Grim Reaper, Mr. Hyde, and a lady Ghost can be found at Boardgame Geeks). The most challenging villain in the base set is the Werewolf but the others are a bit weak compared to those in the expansion sets. The Banshee, Bog Fiend, the Gargoyle, and the Unspeakable Horror fromA Touch of Evil Something Wicked Expansionreally ramp up the challenge level at the cost of having more special abilities to keep track of). The Necromancer (from A Touch of Evil: Hero Pack One) is also challenging, sending waves of tough zombies at the Heroes. You can choose your Heroes and Villain or flip their cards over and choose them randomly (like Arkham or Last Night On Earth). It's also easy to create your own Heroes or Villains (blank templates and examples can be found online).A Touch of Evil Something Wicked Expansionadds an extra map (game board) that links up to the main one (via the Shadowbrook Village Crossroads and a secret passage for speedier between board travel). The new map, Echo Lake, adds new locations (including an Inn, Monastery and the super-dangerous Forgotten Island). Another expansion set is planned for 2010 so the game is being well supported.The rules are not nearly as complex and fiddly as Arkham Horror so it's easy enough to get new players up to speed. The rules include a competitive or cooperative basic game (which covers 90% of the game's rules with scaled down versions of the villain and his minions) and an advanced game. The advanced game mostly adds in extra secrets to provide more Hero interaction with the Town Elders, tougher villains and minions, an add-on rules toolbox to customize the game and rules for Solo and Team play. Team play is probably where the game shines the most, combining the best aspects of competitive and cooperative play. Rules for solo play are included in the Something Wicked expansion.The artwork and components (boards, cards, die-cut counters and miniature Hero figures are all gorgeous and durable, just like Flying Frog's previous zombie game, Last Night On Earth. You really get your money's worth here! The cards are all illustrated with full color photos of real models dressed up like 17th-century characters, complete with powdered wigs, swords and flintlock pistols. Some of these images (like the Vampire villain) can be a little goofy or heavily photoshopped for my taste but most are pretty cool. Overall, the photos are a lot of fun, adding to the game's already rich atmosphere and being consistent with the spooky adventure theme and time period. The game beautifully evokes the look and feel of the Tim Burton movie, Sleepy Hollow, and the old Dracula or Frankenstein movies from Universal Studios and Hammer Films).I highly recommend A Touch of Evil (including its expansions) for fans of Gothic horror and those looking for an alternative or companion to Arkham Horror or other horror-themed board games.",5.0,Best Horror Board Game I've Played,1276560000,"06 15, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,love touch Evil expansion includingA Touch evil Wicked expansion touch evil Hero Pack Allies madness card expansion web exclusive manufacturer play lot Arkham Horror Night Earth Zombie Game enjoy touch evil game fun think touch Evil well capture fun flavor horror adventure game drip theme atmosphere Arkham well appreciate familiar H.P.

In Nature of the Beast, players each have their own deck of cards (which can be customized if necessary), and through clever tactical play are recruiting animals from their deck onto their 3x3 playing field.  Your animals have individual attributes like Combat, Clout, and Cunning, as well as special abilities.  You'll need to move your animals carefully, and can also attack those of your opponents to hinder their progress. The first player to successfully fill their entire field with animals from their deck is the winner.The idea of conscripting well-known animals to your army and pitting them over against your opponent works superbly.  This basic concept of animal armies doing battle is well-integrated with all the aspects of the game, especially the various mechanics, which all make sense on the level of theme.  The artwork complements this theme well, and special note should be made of the wonderful sense of humor that is evident throughout the game, such as in the rulebook, and card flavour text.Not only does the theme feel family friendly and meshes well with the mechanics, but the mechanics themselves feel very fresh and clever.  Many new games today promise all kinds of innovations, but are usually just another take on well-established genres.  In contrast, Nature of the Beast feels genuinely original.  The positional aspect of the game and use of movement and vectors is particularly noteworthy. It gives the game somewhat of a puzzle-like or chess-like feel, without ever becoming abstract, and yet requires real tactical thinking and planning.Because the game requires you to use actions in recruiting and moving animals into and around your field, the game-play has a sharply tactical element to it. You'll need to plan your sequence of moves very carefully, to maximize the advantage of your position as well as the cumulative effect of cards and how they relate to each other, since the influencing vectors are particularly important.  While tactics is the order of the day, long-range strategy is important too. Card games are often associated with luck, and although you are drawing cards from a deck, luck won't be the deciding factor in who wins the game. Rather, the winner will be determined by who can best figure out which animals to recruit, and how to combine the resources at your disposal from Tricks and Troops in order to most cleverly dominate the field of battle. This is a very clever game!Nature of the Beast is an excellent, excellent card game, and the two asymmetrical decks that come in this set are well-balanced and fun.  While the game is expandable and customizable, it works perfectly well as an independent game without need of expansion.  Previous versions of Nature of the Beast were already fantastic, but the Polar vs Praire set takes that successful formula and just makes it better, with a great box insert, player boards, expanded and bigger rulebook, more variants, extra cards, and more.

Some even go so far as to accuse Tammany of connivance in this so-called rampant criminality. What am I to do? I can't have this. Something has to be done.""Tammany Hall is one of the simplest and one of the most viciously political games I have played. These two statements seem contradictory so let's take a look.The Basics - ""You see this knife? I'm gonna teach you to speak English with this ****ing knife!""Tammany Hall is a political control board game in which you play out the unprincipled battles for votes in New York in the late nineteenth century. Using muscle, political tricks and skullduggery you aim to crush your rival and emerge as the dominant political power in Old New York. To do this each turn you can either drop two heavies onto the board (to ensure votes come your way in a precinct) or drop one heavy and move some poor befuddled immigrants into an area (which gets you political influence).  See just a choice of two actions ... easy right?Well after four turns of this there's an election to see who gets mayor (and lots of bonus points). The elections run ward by ward across the city and you win elections by counting up your heavies (who are guaranteed to 'arrange' the vote for you) and blind bidding political influence chips. And this is it gets really, really fun. You stare your friends in the eye and casually explain how you will BURN them if they dare to try contesting the election. You calmly point out that if they fight you here they will lose the next wards they are fighting for and have NOTHING. They of course calmly counter that they have been so kind to the immigrants that their voting power is unassailably and you should beg forgiveness.  Then you reveal your hidden chips and the winners yells out in victory!The Twist - ""The appearance of law must be upheld, especially when it's being broken.""After the election the player with the most wards is declared mayor and scoops up enough victory points to cement their lead. Then they must assign political offices to each of the losers -- these offices are powerful in that they allow these coat-tail grabbing to cheat! To protect a ward from influence, to arrest (remove) immigrant populations, to provide free housing (move populations around) and even just rack in extra influence for doing nothing! And these scoundrels will use their political offices to tear you down -- you! the one who gave them the offices. Ungrateful curs!And More! - ""That, my friends, is the minority vote.""You can slander an opponent forcing his heavies out of a ward and throwing their political machine into confusion. You can control an immigrant population and win even more influence. There are bonus wards which, when won, change the political landscape. Ah, it's tricky rising to the top in old New York!The Play - ""If you get all of us together, we ain't got a gang, we've got an army.""It's a really tight, really focused game. You never have resources to do what you want to do and the other players always have the ability to take down the leader.Now there is one problem in play in that if a player fails utterly in the early round it is impossible for them to catch up alone. And this is the key, the last player should parlay his status as a wild card (he has nothing to lose) to team up with the second player to take down the leader. If you work alone you are either the leader (and crushing all before you -- good luck with that) or you are missing opportunities to ally and snatch victory. Once you've learned to team up (like ragged hyenas) and then turn on your allies in an instant you've learned to play this game.The Box - ""Remember the first rule of politics. The ballots don't make the results, the counters make the results. The counters. Keep counting.""The components (box, board, meeples) are really nice. The only flaw is that you get a sheet of stickers to place on the political favor chips with the flag of the nation (Germany, England, Ireland, Italy) and that's fiddly.Summary - ""Mulberry Street... and Worth... Cross and Orange... and Little Water. Each of the Five Points is a finger. When I close my hand it becomes a fist. And, if I wish, I can turn it against you.""Our group started to use the phrase ""You've been Tammany Hall'd"" to describe when someone had been crushed in other games.

The Injuries/Madnesses - Instead of losing items and being dangerously set back when you run out of Stamina or Sanity, you'll draw an Injury (for no Stamina left) or a Madness (for no Sanity) card which lets you continue on without losing half your items but still wind up at the Asylum or Hospital. The cost is that you incur interesting penalties for each injury. The Injury/Madness decks are made of small cards, with several repeats (getting a duplicate card means you are devoured!).2. Gate Burst - Perhaps the most intriguing addition, and a necessary one, the Gate Burst mechanic causes sealed gates to be torn open. When you draw a Mythos card with the location with an orange background, that means a gate burst occurs at that location. If the location is sealed, it becomes unsealed. This adds quite a bit of tension to the game and keeps the game from slowing down when the major locations are finally sealed (Witchhouse, etc.). The slow-down of the base game is definitely fixed with this mechanic and is quite noticeable as me and my friends are hardcore co-operative horror boardgame players (I'll admit that it's a niche hobby). THIS IS WHY I BOUGHT THE DUNWICH BOARD.3. The Dunwich Horror - Like the devious Terror Track and Doom Track, each expansion offers a sort of countdown to unspeakable horror. For the Dunwich board, it is the presence of the Dunwich Horror - the world-bound spawn of Yog-sothoth. As monsters move around the Dunwich board, they may fall into vortex spaces where they are eaten up and the Dunwich Horror track increases by one. At three, the Dunwich Horror appears as the game's toughest monster yet! When fighting it, it's abilites vary depending on a small deck of large cards that accompany it. The reward is the ability to search out and take any one card from the item/ally/spell decks. I've yet to see him make an appearance, but it's been close and he'll raise the Doom Track as he moves.4. More items, more investigators, more Great Old Ones with even stranger powers (I love Shud'mell and Glaaki). You get more of everything that was in the base game.5. Adds more Arkham location encounter cards (I believe that Dunwich adds the most out of all the other expansions), so this makes it great if it's the only one you want to get for a while.And of course, there are more locations. The size of the Dunwich board is about one third of the Arkham one, but loaded with neighbors and unstable locations. My favorite thing is the look on people's faces when they see how monstrous the board becomes with more and more expansions.The major problem of the Dunwich board is that it suffers from card dilution. As the Mythos deck gets bigger from expansions, you'll draw less Dunwich cards. This can be resolved by separating the Dunwich mythos cards out and rolling a die each turn to see whether you draw from the Dunwich Mythos card deck or the Arkham one. Dunwich probably suffers the most from this sort of card dilution.Ultimately, the pitfalls are greatly exceeded by the advantages. It addresses many problems that made the base game lag in its final stages. I've heard that adding more boards does not affect the play time that much, and may even make it shorter as there are more and more threats.If you're looking for your first Arkham Horror expansion, get this one!

You don't have to have any experience with strategy games (or any games at all) to learn and enjoy this one. The more you play and the better you get at it, the more fun it becomes because you are learning to implement strategy along the way. I can see how it might be frustrating for someone who is just learning if they are playing someone who already know how to play. But in my opinion any game that a novice can play and have an equal chance at winning against someone who has been playing is not a game worth playing at all, much less spending money on. The instructions are a bit unclear at first (at least until you know how to play and then you scratch your head as to why you were confused in the first place). My advice is to play a few rounds with your cards up to learn the ropes before actually PLAYING the game competitively. Each game takes between 20 and 40 minutes, but keep in mind that you'll probably not be able to stop after just one. Sometimes we play five or six games before we know it. I'd also advice mastering the regular deck before experimenting with the expansion cards, but that might just be me.

Depending on who you play with, this can be a very strategic and tense game as you vie for the best roles and the largest stash of gold.If you've played Puerto Rico, then you might be familiar with the role-based mechanic of the game. There are a total of 8 roles in the base game and 10 more in the expansion that comes included (Dark City). Your choice of role provides you with different options to backstab others, build up your own city, or gather the necessary resources. It also determines the turn order. For instance, the Assassin goes first and can choose anyone to assassinate (who ever took that role skips their turn). The Thief goes next and can steal gold from a role.Roles are taken secretly, with some put aside at the start of the turn to make sure no one can easily figure out who is who. You must balance between getting the role you need and the role which no one will suspect you of because the Assassin or Thief can shut you down in a pinch. Once roles are obtained, they are called out one by one in order - if that's your role and you haven't been Assassinated, you go.The eight roles are:Assassin, Thief, Magician, King, Bishop, Merchant, Architech, and WarlordThe expansion adds 14 interesting Special locations. It also adds the following eight roles correspond to and replace ones from the base game (they're similar in spirit but do drastically different things):Witch, Tax Collector, Wizard, Emperor, Abbot, Alchemist, Navigator, DiplomatThe expansion, which is included, as features roles that take up position 9:The Queen, and the ArtistThe artwork on the card are all very interesting and roles themselves take on a life of their own with caricature-like depictions. You'll quickly gain a connection with the style and capabilities of each role (""Damn Warlord!""). We all really get into it.Expansion cards are marked with stars for easy separation.2-7 players, 30-60 minutes (depends on who you play with), and ages 10+ (though one or two locations depict naked people in the background, hard to really pick up on at first but when waiting for the roles to be passed around you might notice)All-in-all, one of my favorite games for casual or intense play. It has plenty of character, quick to pick up, and is deceptively simple - making for great game play on the fly.---TIPS: For your enjoyment and the preservation of the product, I offer some tips:-Put the role cards into plastic card protectors; this will prolong the life of them as they will be shuffled and battered by the players throughout the game-Get more gold counters; this isn't an issue most of the time, but with more players and with certain roles a player can stock up quite a bit of gold at times (this is important when using the expansion characters); quality of the gold counters depends on the version, from cardboard to plastic pieces-Print or write up a card with the numbers of each role; at times, people will forget who goes next and a card like this is not provided",5.0,"Citadels - Deceptively Simple, Outright Fun",1246147200,"06 28, 2009",Toys_and_Games,1,Citadels great addition group gaming headliner Settler Catan Puerto Rico depend play strategic tense game vie good role large stash gold play Puerto Rico familiar role base mechanic game total 8 role base game 10 expansion come include Dark City choice role provide different option backstab build city gather necessary resource determine turn order instance Assassin go choose assassinate take role skip turn thief go steal gold role role take secretly aside start turn sure easily figure balance get role need role suspect Assassin thief shut pinch role obtain call order role assassinate role Assassin Thief Magician King Bishop Merchant Architech warlordthe expansion add 14 interesting special location add follow role correspond replace one base game similar spirit drastically different things):Witch Tax Collector Wizard Emperor Abbot Alchemist Navigator DiplomatThe expansion include feature role position 9 Queen ArtistThe artwork card interesting role life caricature like depiction quickly gain connection style capability role damn Warlord expansion card mark star easy separation.2 7 player 30 60 minute depend play age 10 + location depict naked people background hard pick wait role pass notice)All favorite game casual intense play plenty character quick pick deceptively simple make great game play fly.---TIPS enjoyment preservation product offer tips:-Put role card plastic card protector prolong life shuffle batter player game gold counter issue time player certain role player stock bit gold time important expansion character quality gold counter depend version cardboard plastic piece print write card number role time people forget go card like provide

I do love how all of the pieces in the game come ready-to-play (unlike many miniatures games where you face the daunting task of painting the pieces before you can really enjoy them) and the detail they manage to fit onto this tiny ship is amazing.However, adding this or any of the other expansions to your game does present an ever-growing storage problem. The main game has the box-designed-by-an-idiot problem with the big hole to show off the ships at the store that allows the cardboard tokens to fall out once you open the game. Adding expansions to it, though, is worse - there is no where at all in the original box to store these pieces, and all are fragile enough (as they have to be to be this small) that I wouldn't want to keep them out loose. Of course, they ship in those blister packs that you can't help but destroy as you try to open them, so those are useless for storage as well. I don't want to be $15 for a miniature that's going to break quickly, but I don't know yet how I'm going to store this and the other components to the game to keep them safe, either.",4.0,"Beautiful and fun addition to the game, but makes the storage problem worse",1359244800,"01 27, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,Vader TIE Advanced long favorite Star Wars vehicle excited add piece X Wing Miniatures game love piece game come ready play unlike miniature game face daunting task paint piece enjoy detail manage fit tiny ship amazing add expansion game present grow storage problem main game box design idiot problem big hole ship store allow cardboard token fall open game add expansion bad original box store piece fragile small want loose course ship blister pack help destroy try open useless storage want $ 15 miniature go break quickly know go store component game safe

LoW is limited to 8 turns, unlike the drawn out Agricola, and also unlike Agricola, there is no rush to gather more people to accomplish your goals - your Agents are determined at the start of each game by the number of players.  A variation on Agricola's theme of placing a set number of placards in random order, is the option for a variety of buildings cards, the entire stack of which is not possible to all be built in a single game so you never know which opportunities you might have to develop in that regard (also similar to 7 Wonders age 3 Guilds and Cities expansion Spies cards).Another game-to-game variation is the Lords cards, of which each player is dealt one randomly at the start of the game. These cards determine the type of Quests for which you gain extra Victory Points when scoring is accomplished at the end of the game.  In this way, scoring is similar to Ticket to Ride in tallying up the Quest bonuses, similar to the Destination cards in that game.  While Agricola uses a scoring method more similar to 7 Wonders, with all tallying of points done at the end of the game and no one ever really being sure how they fare against their opponents during the game itself, Lords of Waterdeep grants victory points during the game, again similar to Ticket to Ride, and then again at the end based on your Lord, as previously noted.  The basic 'win' concept is to gain VP's by using adventurers (and gold), who are gained by placing Agents on buildings to acquire them, to complete Quests.  You gain extra VP's based on the type of Quests you've completed from your Lord at the end of the game, but since your Lord is secret from your opponents, the type of Quests that you get bonuses from is also kept secret.While Agricola faces challenges of balancing long-term game strategy over short-term gains, LoW allows for a better mix because of these variations on the theme.  Fewer turns, more visible scoring, and less difficulty determining how to proceed - short term vs. long term, because there really isn't enough time to separate the two and everyone has the same number of chances to gain benefits each turn, unlike Agricola's 'family' building element.Lastly, I can really appreciate the plastic case in the box for which there's even a diagram of how to place the various pieces and cards.  I had a bunch of plastic baggies all ready to go, and I saw that diagram, I know it sounds funny, but I got really excited that Wizards of the Coast thought ahead enough for this type of game to grant the owner the option to have a safe, effective, neat, organized way to store it.

At first the Frozen Wastes seems to complicate the game much more then the base set.  I was unsure at first but as I read through the rules I was very pleased with how the game would be played.The extra rules include: Ancient Artifacts to find (with clue markers to find them, Specific snow bound items such as snow shoes, clues to finding the lost princess, and of course the weather effects.I love these rules.  I think the world of the frozen wastes is well thought out and very fun.  I really enjoy the snowy artwork of the board and cards.  My favorite add on is the weather effects.  The colder it gets the more frost you will take.  This makes it exciting and also more urgent to get to town to warm up between adventuring.  The enemies are great and there is a good range of different kinds.  They add the frost and cold well into the spirit of these characters and enemies.I think the only new rule that wasn't really needed was the clues for finding artifacts.  I think it gets a little clunky and cumbersome to collect all the clues as well as trying to find the right spot to use the clues to find an item.  It's a cool idea but could have been better.  It just makes for a bunch of extra tiles.My one main complaint for this game is the robot and science fiction plot points they add into this High Fantasy World.  The main boss is an alien from another planet who uses his machines to control the climate.  He gets angry and makes it unbearably cold for those who live in the region.  I just think the space ship and alien idea is out of place in the high fantasy world. This is simply my personal opinion and it doesn't really matter in all reality.  The game is fun (VERY FUN) and that is what matters.  Adventuring and leveling up is very rewarding and enjoyable.So if you like an open world fantasy romp then this is a great game.

Wilson,"[3, 4]","Fate is a very different RPG than you're probably used to, if like me, you grew up on D&D; and its offspring.  It does stuff very differently from most other games, but - here's the thing - it does it *phenomenally well.*In place of such specifics as stats, backgrounds, races, classes, etc., characters in Fate Core have &#34;Aspects.&#34;  What's an Aspect?  It's a descriptor of something that could have a narrative effect.  You can use your Aspects to give you a boost on die rolls whenever it's narratively appropriate.  For example, your character might have an Aspect like, &#34;Gangster turned Cop.&#34;  When doing something that's obviously connected to your former gang or policework, you could spend a Fate point (the metagame currency) for a bonus.  However, most Aspects are double-sided and can be compelled against you as well.  So the GM might, to complicate your life, send a goon from the former gang to harass you and cause trouble.  This earns you fate points.Other than Aspects, characters have a set of broad skills.  Quite a lot of them, really, ensuring your character has broad competence in several areas.With that said, Fate Core is more of a toolkit to make an RPG than it is a fully-playable RPG in and of itself.  (At least, without some work on your part.)  It's important to figure out how the various skills work with your milieu and to settle upon &#34;extras&#34; - like magic, weapons, etc. - that might come into play.  The book is very helpful here; large chapters are devoted to showing you how it's done.  But you might want an actual setting volume - like the Fate Worlds books - to help show you the ropes.I'm planning on running a Fate Core version of The Day After Ragnarok soon.

They allow children to open up in a playful way, and create wonderful conversation starters between kids and adults.  With my own child, they are a fun way to chat and learn new things about each other.  With kids and families in therapy, they create opportunities to assess needs and deepen relationships between family members, or between client and therapist.There are so many ways to use them, too!  You can just draw from the deck and shre, or you can pair these cards with another favorite game.  For example, I sometimes bring the cards out along with Checkers or Chess, and anytime someone loses a game piece to the other player, they draw a card and complete the sentence.  I have also paired the cards with Jenga, Don't Break the Ice, Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, and many other childhood games.Kids love the adorable artwork, and the fact that they can answer their own way makes these cards a non-threatening way to get to know someone new or deepen a relationship with someone trusted.I highly recommend this and other Bright Spots products to anyone with children from about age three (adults read the card aloud for the child) to adult.",5.0,Wonderful product I've used for years!,1293753600,"12 31, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,parent teacher counselor therapist card have!I purchase card time year professional personal use gift   allow child open playful way create wonderful conversation starter kid adult   child fun way chat learn new thing   kid family therapy create opportunity assess need deepen relationship family member client therapist way use   draw deck shre pair card favorite game   example bring card Checkers Chess anytime lose game piece player draw card complete sentence   pair card Jenga break Ice Candyland chute ladder childhood game kid love adorable artwork fact answer way make card non threatening way know new deepen relationship trust highly recommend bright spot product child age adult read card aloud child adult

While it could be used as a stand alone program, it is best used in tandem with classwork.  That being said, this program is light-years ahead of Rosetta Stone for Arabic which I have found to be pretty useless for Arabic learning.  Rosetta Stone only reviews words that you have to guess from the pictures(they are often very confusing), and Rosetta does not offer a vocabulary book or grammar which is essential in learning any language.  I like Pimsleur programs; but, unfortunately they do not make one for MSA, only for the dialects.  Tell Me More is an awesome program because it makes learning fun and interactive for those who get bored easily.  It is especially good for kinestic and visual learners because there is a heavy influence of Auditory learning with this program that helps pronounce words correctly and helps learners who find listening alone a hard way to learn.The way the program works is that it has several levels to work with and takes the learner through different topics:  if you want to learn about the weather - click on that section; about families -click on that section.  Because it is so organized, it is easy to focus on topics that you want to review.  Furthermore, there are about 10 activities to do per topic.  For example, you can review the vocabulary, take a test using the words in sentences, learn how to pronounce words by comparing your voice to a natives (the best function of the program), learn new grammar, etc.  It is a very easy product to use as well (basically install and everything is ready to go - make sure you by a good headset as well) This is definitely a program worth its price!",5.0,Great Arabic program for beginners +,1229126400,"12 13, 2008",Toys_and_Games,1,good program find Modern Standard Arabic reinforce knowledge learn   stand program well tandem classwork   say program light year ahead Rosetta Stone Arabic find pretty useless arabic learning   Rosetta Stone review word guess pictures(they confusing Rosetta offer vocabulary book grammar essential learn language   like Pimsleur program unfortunately MSA dialect   tell awesome program make learn fun interactive bored easily   especially good kinestic visual learner heavy influence Auditory learn program help pronounce word correctly help learner find listen hard way learn way program work level work take learner different topic   want learn weather click section family -click section   organized easy focus topic want review   furthermore 10 activity topic   example review vocabulary test word sentence learn pronounce word compare voice native good function program learn new grammar etc   easy product use basically install ready sure good headset definitely program worth price

There are no Jedi and there are no other Eras that you can play.  You can basically play during the time from right before Episode IV to Episode V (Around maybe a 5 year span).  Now this was intentional by the game designers.  Doesn't mean that I liked this approach though.  Characters that you can play are , like the title suggests, literally from the places where the Empire doesn't have a strong hold of the galaxy (Smugglers, Bounty Hunters, Explorers).  If you want to play Rebels or Jedi you will have to wait for the other books.  If you want to play in other Eras... well, Fantasy Flight is quiet about whether they will support those Eras.  The reason why I do not like this is because the Empire Era of Star Wars is from 35 years ago.  While this is the favorite Era of many people it only represents a small portion of the entire Star Wars Expanded Universe which includes the 3 prequels, the Clone Wars animated series, and the hundreds of books.My second reason why I did not give this game 5 stars is because the combat system just doesn't cut it for me.  While the dice mechanics of the game are great for what is called Narrative game play, the way the game determines how one is hit and damaged just doesn't fit.  It's too easy for someone to be hit in combat.  And while it's hard to get killed, you can be knocked unconscious quite easily.  Grabbing cover doesn't mean much.  To get any good defenses one has to mine the Talent trees for defensive abilities.  This problem can be seen in ship combat as well.  I feel like it would have been better to instead of tracking hit points like just about every other RPG out there, there should have been system more like the original Star Wars RPG.As I said before, I like this game.  The book itself is full of information, the art is beautiful, and the layout is well done.  Hopefully, after a couple years, there will be new supplements that will eliminate my first issue with it.

Zogheib ""Rylune""","[43, 43]","The first thing I will say is what the owner of the game store told me to convince me to buy Thunderstone. It plays like Dominion. If you are a fan of Dominion, chances are you will like this game. In fact I think it is better for a couple of reasons. First, remember how Dominion games tend to end quickly in 2 player or with certain card setups? Everyone grabs 2 or 3 Provinces and it is over. The game ending card in this game, the Thunderstone, is guaranteed to be in the bottom 10 cards of the 31 card monster deck. That means everyone will have a chance to build their deck to work well. Also the victory point cards (monsters) are worth gold when they end up in your hand. In Dominion the victory cards are generally dead cards during the game. So often people ignore the lower point cards and rush straight for the big ones. There are times when you will kill the monster worth 0 or 1 victory points just because it is worth 3 or 4 gold when it is in your hand.If you have never played Dominion I will try to explain. You can find actual game rules at AEG's (the producer) website or on Board Game Geek. It is a deck building game. That is, you building a deck as you play the game. You can either go to the Village and improve your deck or go the dungeon and kill monsters. Generally monsters are the only source of victory points. There are a few exceptions but you cannot win without killing some monsters.You start each game with a set hand of 12 cards and start each turn with 6 cards. As you kill monsters, buy cards, or level up heroes you put those new cards into your discard pile. At the end of your turn, discard your hand and draw 6 new cards. When you have no more cards left to draw you shuffle your discard pile and it becomes your deck. So as the game progresses you are adding cards to your deck which will eventually end up as part of your hand.The goal is to have as many victory points as possible when the game ends. The game ends when a player either gets the Thunderstone (by killing the monster carrying it) or when the Thunderstone makes it to the end of the dungeon. There are 31 monster cards in the monster deck and the Thunderstone is shuffled into the bottom 10. At any given point, only 3 monsters are revealed. So it does take time to play a full game (30 minutes to an hour for most games depending on what cards are in play and how many players).When building your deck throughout the game remember that your ultimate goal is to get victory points, which means you have to be able to kill monsters, which means you need to have a high attack score when you go to the dungeon and some cards that produce light. You can read how exactly the combat works in the rules but I wanted to explain that to someone that was new to deck building card games.Every game has 3 random monster types, 4 random heroes, and 8 random village cards. So chances are you will never play the exact same game twice. A strategy that works great one game may not work at all the next. Maybe one game you have a lot of fighter heroes but not much magic. Maybe next game you play with a lot of monsters that are hard to kill without magic. One game you may have heroes that produce light by themselves. Next game you may have to buy cards whose only job is to produce light.All of this makes the game have great replay value. Since the setups constantly change, your strategies will change, meaning it will not feel like the same exact game over and over again.The rules that come with the game are a bit of a mess but fortunately AEG produced a new set of rules that lay out turn orders and answer a lot of questions. Find the new rules online. Also there are rules for solo play either at AEG or BoardGame Geek. The solo format is a great way to learn how to build faster decks. and unlike many games that are meant for 2+ but have solo rules, the solo variant plays very well.The game is for 2-5 players. Unfortunately there is no way to have more than 5 players now. The 12 card decks everyone starts with are the same every game and there are only enough Militia cards for 5 players. If you want to try 6-8 players the game may work, though you might need to tweak some things, but you will need more than one copy of the game.The cards fit perfectly into standard card sleeves. I have all of my cards in Dragonshield sleeves.Overall it is a fun game with a lot of variety and is right up there with any other card game. I've played about 30-40 multiplayer games and 10 solo games and still enjoy the challenge every time I pull it out. I would recommend it to anyone that liked Dominion or other deck building games. For someone that never tried a similar game but liked CCGs like Magic, I'd say give it a chance. The style may be different but it is easy to understand for anyone that has played CCGs. It will probably take anywhere from a few turns all the way to a full game or two to realize what is going on.

The tiles and figures add to the theme's feel. Arguably the tiles could have been illustrated with more detail and variety (I'm thinking of Descent's gorgeous tiles), but they're pretty nice and made from a sturdy stock. The figures are fantastic, except for (disappointingly), Vlad himself, who looks the furthest thing from imposing, especially when compared to the bone dragon or any of the heroes. Kinda looks like Seth Green wearing clothes that are too big for him, unfortunately. Gameplay is not terribly complicated but you will have to invest a little time with the rulebook (or fans' youtube videos), especially if you've had no D&D experience. Once you do, the game is immensely fun and satisfying, and the creepy theme really shines (oozes?) through, but I will warn you it is challenging. You will find yourself cheating a bit in the first few games, because you didn't realize you should have done some other action prior but didn't know the game well enough, or just because it's a hard game but you want to go a little further to see what's ahead. For example in the first solo game, the game ends when you finally get to the Secret Staircase. If you're lucky enough to have this tile be at the top of your stack, you're golden. You'll fight a few monsters and win. But more often than not, you'll be turning over tile after tile and the monsters don't stop coming. You'll be wondering where that #$^$^ tile is. If it's near the bottom, you're screwed (and I hope you have enough table space.

This is an indicator that the battery has suffered damage to the cell. Recharging them immediately after a flight is highly not recommended. Let the battery cool for at least 10-15 minutes before recharging it. Otherwise, you're likely to overheat the battery making it more susceptible to violently discharge causing it to explode in fire.Staying with the battery while charging/recharging is highly recommended. And, most often charging on a concrete floor is the safest of all.Because of the size of this particular battery it's a 3.7v 150mah, it obviously will NOT violently explode as with much larger batteries like a 2200mah 3s battery would.

However, in the meantime, I've been playing it with my girlfriend, and it's obvious that it's got a ton of replayabiltity. The way you construct the mythos deck, and the large number of encounter cards guarantees no two games play the same, even against the same Old One. I haven't tried it with more than two yet, but with two people the difficulty level seems just right -- we've got about a 50% legitimate win rate. The negatives are that there are lots of pieces to keep track of (especially with the reckoning mechanic), and the full spread is pretty big.

That said, I picked this up, because I am a fan of the setting and because I wanted to dig into a all-new RPG system that was not another D20 offshoot or another percentile-based system (like Dark Heresy, WFRP 2Ed., etc)I'll have to be honest. When I read this RPG (and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire - another FFG RPG that is based off this system) I was so hooked by the concept that I put together a new group to try it out!I love the Runes system. The math is there for those who dig deep enough, but the abstract nature of the symbols allow for an extremely narrative style of play (something that has been missing from other 'Mathy' RPGs for a while, IMHO) when you roll, it becomes more of a 'reading the tea leaves' type experience. The Gamemaster and the player work together to 'interpret' the result and explain the story as it unfolds (i.e. &#34;How could I have rolled so many advantages, but not a single success?&#34; well perhaps your shots did not hit their mark, but the flurry of arrows forced your enemy out of cover, flustered ... that sort of thing). I also like the fact that there is a system that rewards creative roleplaying. If you want to take advantage of a basic skill or advantage, you get just that: the basic reward. If you can creatively construct a deeply descriptive way of executing a bold maneuver, your GM has a measured way to reward you with scalable boosts.The downside to all this is an extremely 'fiddly' game full of action/ability cards and dice that can be a bit awkward to interpret at times.This game also suffers from feature creep, a common drawback to FFG RPG products as the content is largely locked down and requires MANY, MANY $60 books to get a full set of rules that SHOULD have been in the $99 Core set.Still, if you can find a reasonably priced set, I recommend it for RPG collectors and fans of the Warhammer universe.",4.0,"Great 'Narrative' System, but a bit fiddly",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1,hi Gregg rule reader.(Hi gregg)yes know like rpg fan read rulebook play say pick fan setting want dig new rpg system D20 offshoot percentile base system like Dark Heresy WFRP 2ed etc)i'll honest read rpg Star Wars Edge Empire FFG rpg base system hooked concept new group try out!I love Runes system math dig deep abstract nature symbol allow extremely narrative style play miss Mathy rpg IMHO roll read tea leave type experience Gamemaster player work interpret result explain story unfold i.e. 34;how roll advantage single success?&#34 shot hit mark flurry arrow force enemy cover flustered sort thing like fact system reward creative roleplaying want advantage basic skill advantage basic reward creatively construct deeply descriptive way execute bold maneuver GM measured way reward scalable boost downside extremely fiddly game action ability card dice bit awkward interpret time game suffer feature creep common drawback FFG rpg product content largely lock require $ 60 book set rule $ 99 Core set find reasonably price set recommend rpg collector fan Warhammer universe

What usually happens with longer board games is two people will get the game set up and refresh themselves on the rules (or learn them if it is the first time playing the game).

Last night my wife and I played it for the first time, and as with Lost Cities, we loved it.Immediately after playing we wanted to play again.  There is no doubt in my mind that we will not tire of the game.  The common quality that Lost Cities and Ingenious share are the ""addiction"" factor; both games will have you saying ""let's play again"" over and over again at the expense of sleep.  I don't believe a greater compliment can be said about a game than this.Ingenious is incredibly easy to learn, and takes less than 1 minute after setting the game up for you to begin playing.  Game play consists of playing hexagonal chips of 6 different colors on a board in turn-based play.  The chips are like hexagonal dominoes, have 2 hexes connected, and each hex containing a different color. Once no chips can be placed upon the board, the game is over. The player who has the lowest amount of points for any of the 6 colors loses.  Game strategy requires that you score points for each color, and this requires concentration and strategy.Understand that Ingenious is not a strategy game that will leave you frustrated, overwhelmed and weary. No, ingenious is not like that. Ingenious has just enough strategy to have you scampering to win, and just enough random luck to make it unpredictable.  And my favorite part of Ingenious?  All players know that when the board is full, the game is over.  There is an end in sight, and just like Lost Cities, you play against yourself just as much as you play against your opponent.  Your strategies can kill you, or leave you the victor.  Spend too much time acquiring points for one color, and you might sacrifice your victory.Try it, you won't regret it.  I paid over $35 at my local gaming store, and it was worth every dollar.  The game is of sturdy components, as to assure you will be playing it in 10 years.  For 1 to 4 players.  Yes!

Guck ""FujiToast""","[0, 0]","I started playing this game thanks to the new Pocket Ticket to Ride on iPhone and iPod Touch and now I'm hooked. It only took a week for me to decide I needed the actual board game version of this as well. I have to admit that though the rules are VERY simple, when you try explain them to someone who's never played, they will often kinda look at you blanky, only understanding a part of what you're telling them. But all it takes is one play through for everybody to understand. And usually they say, ""That was cool! Lets play again now that I understand it better!"" The game is great for basically elementary ages and up, you can not be too old for this one. The game is a bit on the expensive side though it does seem to be cheaper on amazon then everywhere else, including a certain well known auction site. Though the game quality and organization inside the box is well thought through. The only thing that is annoying is the size of the cards. They are significantly smaller than standard playing cards making the handling and shuffling a little difficult. Though that can be fixed by purchasing the 1910 expansion pack which includes full size cards, but obviously that's another $15-$20 purchase. So is the game fun and addicting? You bet it is. Is it too expensive? Well yeah, kinda, but if you have some friends and family that really enjoy board games, then I think it's worth it. It's about the same price as taking a family of four out to the movies anyway.If you're on the fence about purchasing this game and you own an iOS device, I've got some simple advice for you. Buy the $1 dollar app and give it a try, You'll know within a few game plays if this one is for you. And my bet is it probably is.Oh and my other small gripe is the placement of Duluth. I understand that Duluth was a large trade city at the time of the railroad boom but they put it in the place of Minneapolis/St. Paul. They really should've either moved Duluth up to Superior (It's correct location) or changed the name on the board to St. Paul.

Unlike most games that require a minimum of 2-3 players for optimal play with Party Gras the opposite is true. The more people you have playing the more fun it is, and because it can accommodate such a large number of players nobody ever has to feel left out or like they have to team up with another player just to make sure everybody can play. (Which is one of my biggest complaints at game night is having to play something like Settlers of Catan on a team.)Party Gras has a simple enough premise: Get all the beads you can (just like Mardi Gras)! But how you get those beads is what makes this game such a riot. Along with the strands of beads that every player starts out with each player is given a card with a task that they either must do or convince another player to do. Once their card has been completed they show it to another player and receive a strand of their beads in exchange.This game is great for large family gatherings if you're a loud, boisterous, outgoing family; ice breakers for small conferences and group settings; and at any type of party. Also, the game is super flexible because you can play until somebody has ALL the beads (which I honestly think might be impossible if your friends and family are as competitive as mine are) or you can have a predetermined time limit for the game and whoever has the most beads at the end of that time period is the winner.Overall it's a fun game and great if you've got a large group to play with.",5.0,Great Party Game!

{'$oid': '5a13282c741a2384e879e359'},A1A3U8OMJ6R2QR,1589949048,Luke Keppler,"[61, 63]","Let me get this out of the way first.I'm a proud owner of the original 1985 edition published by Games Workshop, along with the Heroes of DungeonQuest and Catacombs expansions.  There are an absolute myriad of unscripted ways in which you can die, and your job is to survive with as much loot as possible.  Thank DungeonQuest for turning me into a connoisseur of rogue-like video games such as NetHack,Diablo, ADOM, and evenToeJam & Earl.DungeonQuest (1985 edition) has been an almost unmatched favorite board game of mine for over 20 years.  In fact, I purchasedDescent: Journeys in the Darkin an attempt to find an newer game with similar gameplay to DungeonQuest.  Alas, Descent is great, but doesn't scratch the itch.  When I heard that Fantasy Flight Games picked up publishing rights, I anxiously awaited their release with skepticism.  I could finally stop worrying about losing/damaging the long out-of-print contents, but only if they could reproduce the experience!I've played this 2010 edition of DungeonQuest very aggressively both solo and with up to 3 players (age 30+).  Ready to pass judgement.  I'll try to clarify for new players, though there are many references to changes from the 1985 edition.Pros:- Custom characters.  Each of the 6 unique characters has meaningfully distinct perks.  Depending on which character you draw at the start, you will significantly change your combat or exploration strategy.- Catacombs.  Including what was previously an entire expansion (as well as 2 extra characters), is very generous.  Catacombs are much more dangerous, but offer faster, diagonal movement beneath the dungeon floor.- Extended sundown.  Game lasts longer than before, giving chance to survive after the doors would normally have locked you in the dungeon to die.  The increasing chance of death looms like a game of Russian-roulette (why not, since you should be dead by then in the original anyway).Cons:- Sell-out.  Obviously, some things were changed just to fit Terrinoth, rather than having Terrinoth fit DungeonQuest.  Most of this is not bad, and, in fact, the 6 new cross-over character sheets for Descent more than make up for this downside!  However, it's more than a bit unnatural to run into ""easy"" demons and trolls in the once goblin-filled dungeon.  Similarly, the combat system uses melee, ranged, and magic instead of the more natural melee-only stances.- Chance of survival has increased.  Based on my 28 plays, there's a 32.1% chance of survival.  The original survival rate was 15%.  I've had games where all 3 smart players successfully survived with loot.  Terrible.  Life should feel much more fleeting and precious.- Combat card mini-game is complex.  In the original, I enjoyed reading my opponent's face in the ""slash > leap > mighty blow > slash"" intuitive combat.  Some immersion is lost in the new combat card game.  It's much more strategic, but also more abstract.  Though, even newcomers to board gaming can pick it up after about 2 games.- Catacomb movement is unintuitive.  For instance, in the catacombs, movement is only diagonal, but the player is asked to declare a compass direction (N, S, E, W) upon entering.  In the original, this compass direction was the predominate movement direction, but in this version, the player is necessarily offset into a NW, NE, SW, SE direction on exit.Changes:- Includes Catacombs; an expansion in the original.- Includes 6 heroes; the original started with 4.- Rules are clearer; addition of ~10 official optional rules.- Combat is more complicated, but retains rock-paper-scissors elements.- Heroes are more legendary; likewise, mundane orcs are now trolls, golems, demons, etc.- Arrows are gone, so bows no longer have ammo; they're abstracted into new combat.- Pets are gone, hence no separate HP; they're abstracted into new combat.- Not limited to 26 turns; sun has increasing chance to set after turn 26.- Rings are now runes (and different).Complex combat rules and much better chance of survival slowly become less of a downside as you play.  In fact, you get used to the combat, learning to build feeling into it.  The more abstract combat mostly comes when using one of the characters that has no pro-combat perk or lame combat cards.  I'm loving the extended sundown and unique, unpredictable potions and other new loot.  Catacomb deviation isn't crazy either when you look at it as diagonal movement from the start.As in the original, there are numerous cases where a player must remember to resolve certain rules in following turns, despite no on-board representation.  Also, many tiles have special rules that need to be frequently looked up until remembered.

Star Wars: The Card Game, however, bucks that trend in a big way. It's a deep, but very fun game that FEELS like Star Wars, and that's a very impressive feat for a card game to pull off. Complexity-wise I'd put this between the other two FFG I've played: Android: NetRunner (more complex) and Call of Cthulu Card Game (less complex) but it's as fun, if not more so, than those two awesome games but it's not just a variant or rip-off of those or any other game that I've played. This is completely its own game, with its own mechanics, and its own feel.Prior to conflict you do what's called an Edge Battle where you basically discard cards one at a time in hopes of getting more Force icons than your opponent (the downside is you lose those cards), and this fun bit of bluffing and jockeying is for the all-important ""edge"" of going first when combat resolves, then you alternate as either sides characters attack each other and opposing objectives. Between turn actions you resolve a Force Struggle, where both sides compare characters ""committed"" to their struggle to see if anyone gets a force bonus to their cause: Dark Side is basically trying to get to 12 of their Death Star turn marker while Light Side is trying to destroy 3 Dark Side objectives before that happens. These combined with the cards themselves, the Units, locations, events, all add up to a giving a story-like feel to the game that's just fantastic. If you like Star Wars, this game is for you...you'll like it even more. If you're one of the few that don't (why are you reading this?) but you enjoy a well-made, really fun card game then this is also for you.",5.0,"""That's No Moon, It's a Space Station.""",1371427200,"06 17, 2013",Toys_and_Games,1,grow accustomed game license attach completely lame shallow copy game surface level change theme Star war card Game buck trend big way deep fun game FEELS like Star Wars impressive feat card game pull complexity wise FFG play Android NetRunner complex Cthulu Card Game complex fun awesome game variant rip game play completely game mechanic feel prior conflict call Edge Battle basically discard card time hope get Force icon opponent downside lose card fun bit bluffing jockey important edge go combat resolve alternate side character attack opposing objective turn action resolve Force Struggle side compare character commit struggle get force bonus cause Dark basically try 12 Death Star turn marker Light try destroy 3 dark objective happen combine card Units location event add give story like feel game fantastic like Star Wars game you'll like read enjoy fun card game

Not only are the rules themselves a hoot, but the prose used to describe them is brilliant. In tone and vocabulary, the writing is a perfect match for the old-school fantasy stories that inspired the original D&D; books, and there's a wonderfully sadistic wit running through the entire manual.Along with this top-notch word-smithery, the book practically spews delightful art on you. It's brimming from start-to-finish with copious illustrations, many of them worked into the graphic design as layout elements in a way that makes the rules come alive. All of the art feels authentic to the 1970s inspiration from which it is drawn, and just like the old D&D; books, some of the pieces have a delightfully crude or simplistic style while others are gorgeous works of impeccably skilled artists. I'm a big fan of the high-flown color art in the Pathfinder books (not such a big fan of that in the 4E books), and I'm ordinarily skeptical of RPGs that rely on black-and-white printing and art, but in this case, it's a tour-de-force accomplishment, not a drawback. The artists and graphic designers have captured a look and feel that I never expected to see again in a modern RPG publication, and they've done so in a way that demonstrates a true love of the original source material.As for the system itself, it is manic, inventive, straighforward, ingenious, easy-to-grasp and rich all at once. My group hasn't played it yet, but we had a ball rolling up characters at our last gaming session, and I can't wait to jump in.At almost 500 pages, with this kind of writing and art, and sporting three complete, ready-to-play adventures, this is a must-have for any RPG old-timers, and I suspect will provide vast entertainment for newer players as well.",5.0,"Unbelievably, Head-Crushingly Brilliant",1341619200,"07 7, 2012",Toys_and_Games,1,fun read rpg rulebook sincethe die Earth rpg rule hoot prose describe brilliant tone vocabulary writing perfect match old school fantasy story inspire original D&D book wonderfully sadistic wit run entire manual notch word smithery book practically spews delightful art brim start finish copious illustration work graphic design layout element way make rule come alive art feel authentic 1970 inspiration draw like old D&D book piece delightfully crude simplistic style gorgeous work impeccably skilled artist big fan high fly color art Pathfinder book big fan 4E book ordinarily skeptical rpg rely black white printing art case tour de force accomplishment drawback artist graphic designer capture look feel expect modern rpg publication way demonstrate true love original source material system manic inventive straighforward ingenious easy grasp rich group play ball roll character gaming session wait jump 500 page kind writing art sport complete ready play adventure rpg old timer suspect provide vast entertainment new player

Given the board-game elements and the very streamlined rules, it was very easy to introduce the game.  The box also contains a really good starter dungeon.  My siblings went off the side of the map, and I ended up slotting in a dungeon made by Chris Perkins (google DnD Robot Chicken) into that blank space.  By the time they finished the dungeon, they managed to kill a whole tribe of goblins, fight their way through a small army of skeletons, and several giant spiders.  They had a ton of loot, and ended by driving off a young Black Dragon.

Burrese ""Author, Speaker, Mediator, ...","[2, 3]","I waited for Christmas to give the game ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer: The DVD Game"" to my little girl.  She loves the Rudolph shows, and even wore her Rudolph shirt when we played the game.  It is a cute game, and the entire family had fun playing it.  Sure, us adults would not have played if it wasn't for the little one (she's 6), but the excitement my little girl showed while playing made it fun for all of us.  It is a good family game, and like the box says, ""Perfect For Family Holiday Fun!""The game is advertized for ages six to adult, and my six year old had no trouble understanding and playing the game.  It is good for 2-4 players, or if you have more you can play as teams.  The box contains the game board, four player moves and stands, a Bumble the Abominable Snow Monster mover and stand, twenty toy tokens, a Bumble toy counter, numbered die, the game DVD, and instructions.Playing the game is pretty easy, you roll the die and move around the various paths and try to land on the toy tokens.  The object is to collect three different colored toy tokens before the other players and before Bumble the Abominable Snow Monster collects six toys.The hard part is earning the toy tokens when you land on them.  You must play the DVD and answer a question.  These are not as easy as you might think.  I'm ashamed to say, I missed a question.  Some questions show you a scene from the movie and you must then answer the question after watching it.  There is one where you see a jack in the box and the boxes are mixed up and you have to then guess what box Jack is in.  I followed the box pretty easy, but a couple in the group didn't follow as well.  So, it is not super easy.  It challenged the adults a bit.  (The one I missed was a question where you had to look at a scene and then answer a question.  I failed to remember what color something was due to focusing on a different part of the picture that I was sure the question would be about - shame on me.)Over all, it was a fun family game.  Downside is you must have a TV and DVD player to play.  Sometimes it is nice to have games to get away from the television set.  However, if you have a TV and DVD player, it is a fun game and in the words of my daughter when I asked her to describe the game, ""Fun, Great, Perfect!""",4.0,"My six year old daughter said, ""Fun, Great, Perfect!""",1293408000,"12 27, 2010",Toys_and_Games,1,"wait Christmas game Rudolph Red nosed reindeer DVD Game little girl   love Rudolph show wear Rudolph shirt play game   cute game entire family fun play   sure adult play little 6 excitement little girl show play fun   good family game like box say Perfect Family Holiday Fun!""The game advertize age adult year old trouble understand play game   good 2 4 player play team   box contain game board player move stand bumble abominable Snow monster mover stand toy token Bumble toy counter number die game DVD instruction play game pretty easy roll die path try land toy token   object collect different colored toy token player Bumble abominable Snow Monster collect toy hard earn toy token land   play dvd answer question   easy think   ashamed miss question   question scene movie answer question watch   jack box box mix guess box Jack   follow box pretty easy couple group follow   super easy   challenge adult bit   miss question look scene answer question   fail remember color focus different picture sure question shame me.)over fun family game   downside tv dvd player play   nice game away television set   tv dvd player fun game word daughter ask describe game Fun Great Perfect"

A few years ago, a friend turned me onto the idea of the cooperative board game Shadows Over Camelot, which intrigued me at the time.  How hard could it be to beat a board game, with the help of my friends?  Turns out, it can be pretty difficult.One element of Shadows Over Camelot that I really loved, however, is the traitor mechanic.  While there are strictly cooperative board games, I really enjoy the idea of deceiving my ""allies,"" pretending to be helpful, while secretly subverting their efforts for victory.  Alas, over the course of perhaps ten or so games of Shadows Over Camelot, I have never gotten the opportunity to be the traitor.Enter Battlestar Galactica.  I heard about this game only recently, while experiencing the series for the first time via Netflix.  The deception that can be found in Shadows Over Camelot is more prevalent in Battlestar Galactica.  Rather than there being a chance of a single traitor among up to seven players, Battlestar ensures at least one traitor (Cylons, in keeping with the theme of the show), and indeed can have up to three in a six player game.Mechanically, there is a lot more opportunity for traitors to do treacherous things, as about one skill check is played per turn, which lets players secretly contribute to either passing or failing the check.And really, that is what the game is about.  Yes, it is modeled after the recent reboot TV series, but you don't have to watch the show to enjoy the game.  It certainly augments enjoyment, but I have introduced the game to friends who have never watched the series, and it holds up well enough to keep them interested.The only complaints I have are that the rule book isn't as well written as it needs to be, requiring several online FAQs and errata for clarification, and that the game is pretty long, especially on the first play.  The game is supposed to last between two and three hours (a pretty big time commitment to begin with), but my group's first session lasted more than five hours.  It was a fun five hours, but a lot of the time it's difficult to convince people to play a game knowing that it won't be done for quite a while.Otherwise, I wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody looking for a game whose central theme is that of deception and treachery.  The rest of the game mechanics are fine, but nothing beats trying to read your friends, or lying to their faces and then laughing about it later.",5.0,Treachery is always fun,1304035200,"04 29, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1,fan strategy board game half dozen year   year ago friend turn idea cooperative board game Shadows Camelot intrigue time   hard beat board game help friend   turn pretty difficult element shadow Camelot love traitor mechanic   strictly cooperative board game enjoy idea deceive ally pretend helpful secretly subvert effort victory   ala course game Shadows Camelot get opportunity traitor Enter Battlestar Galactica   hear game recently experience series time Netflix   deception find Shadows Camelot prevalent Battlestar Galactica   chance single traitor seven player Battlestar ensure traitor cylon keep theme player game mechanically lot opportunity traitor treacherous thing skill check play turn let player secretly contribute pass fail check game   yes model recent reboot tv series watch enjoy game   certainly augment enjoyment introduce game friend watch series hold interested complaint rule book write need require online FAQs errata clarification game pretty long especially play   game suppose hour pretty big time commitment begin group session last hour   fun hour lot time difficult convince people play game know will wholeheartedly recommend anybody look game central theme deception treachery   rest game mechanic fine beat try read friend lie face laugh later

Easy enough, right? No problem, as long as your luck holds...We have played this game three times now with players age ranging from 12 - 40something, and everyone has enjoyed it so far. The game itself works on a 'push your luck' concept, which is always a lot of fun to see when the bold get rewarded, but the overly daring pay the price. It is especially rewarding to see the kids find the right balance. Two out of the three games were very close in score making for an exciting game right up to the end of tallying the score. The other game was a decisive victory as all but one player pressed their luck too far and were trapped inside the tomb.The game can be played from opening the box to packing everything back up in roughly an hour, add about half an hour for first time players to get up to speed. The turns seem a bit complex at first, but by the second time around the board even the kids had the routine down pat.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is considering buying it.

The writing style is easy to read, and having played the game I found game-play to feel fairly well balanced. There are only two issues I have that keep me from giving this book five stars.First: The book does not contain a simple step-by-step set of instructions on how to roll up a character sheet. I don't know how they forgot that little detail. Instead characters are covered over a 90+ page chapter that must be slogged through painstakingly in order properly apply modifiers, etc. A couple of simplified charts or a 5 page nuts/bolts rundown would have been a huge benefit. I would be much more irritated about this than I actually am, except that some good Samaritans on the internet have pretty much filled this gap - still this is a big thing to miss.Second: The spine of the book, even brand new, seems ready to break and fall apart. The cover is so flimsy it feels like it is warping around the pages, just barely containing them. I feel like the book won't last through 2 months of use before pages start falling out. The physical quality of the book itself is extremely disappointing, considering the price. Honestly, if you are going to make a book this crappily, you might as well sell a pdf version for half the price, and save yourself the printing costs.

Since my first play, I have gained a lot of respect for the game and the way it plays. Here's some thoughts on that:Gameplay - I'll only touch briefly on the basic game concepts here. Some players play as zombies, others as heroes on a board made of randomly chosen L squares around a center board. This means that the layout of the town is a little different during each game. Also, the game comes with several different scenarios that outline the victory conditions for each side. This helps make it so the game is a little different each time. Usually the hero players are trying to accomplish a specific goal (leaving town, saving townsfolk, etc.) and the zombie player(s) are trying to stop them. There is conflict (melee and ranged), but no player is ever eliminated from the game (though his original hero might be).Components - The game comes with several boards and a ton of minis (14 zombies and one for each hero). It also comes with a lot of punch-out chits for different things. The components are well made and durable (mine still look great after a year). The minis are well detailed, though they are not painted. The cards have an interesting art style based on actual pictures. I think they do a great job capturing the b-movie style of the game.Theme - As mentioned, this is a b-movie sort of game. The cards and quotes lend themselves to being both horror and comedy. In short, it's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously, and I like that. For the most part, I do think that the gameplay feels consistent with the theme. There are some exceptions, but very few things will pull you out of the experience.Fun - Alright. As far as I'm concerned this is the one that really matters. Is the game fun, and why? Firstly, this is a game that is about theme and conflict. That may turn some people off, but that's some of what I like most about it. The first time I played LNOE I played the 'Die Zombie Die' scenario as the instructions recommend. My friends and I had to consult the instructions pretty often since situations will come up that reqiure some specificity. The scenario for this play was just for the heroes to defeat a certain number of zombies before time ran out. To be honest, our initial reaction was absolutely 'meh.' 'Die Zombie Die' felt slow, unthematic, and predictable. To be honest, we didn't play again. But then I got a copy of the game for Christmas from my wife, so of course we had to give it another shot.It became pretty clear that the first time people played LNOE, they generally weren't too excited. For the first-time player, the game often feels lopsided in balance and somewhat predictable (especially if you use the DZD scenario). What became clear, however, is that when people gave the game a second chance it got much more interesting. The more you play the game, the more you begin to see a deeper level of strategy than you first suspected. The games get more interesting, and they get closer.At the start, myself and the other players felt sure that the game was misblanaced towards the zombie player. It always felt like that person won. Over time, however, we started to get better and the win ratio began to balance itself out (it stands now at right about 50/50 since we started keeping an actual record).All in all, I think LNOE is a game that should be played at least a couple of times to really judge. The more familiar with the game your players are, the more likely you'll have a close, suspensful game. You'll certainly still have a lopsided victory or two (luck demands it), but it will even out over time.Luck - I've heard the complaint several times that luck plays a bigger role than skill in LNOE. That may be a valid statement. A bad roll on an attack or movement can absolutely lose the game for a team. For me, that adds to the uncertainty and suspense of a game. Sure, it frustrates me when the dice don't seem to go my way, but I can live with that. If you prefer games with little or no chance element, this probably isn't the game for you.Expansions - This review is just for the base game, so I won't touch much on individual expansions. I felt, however, that I should at least mention it. As you can see on the main BGG page, LNOE has quite a few available expansions. While you might be interested in some more than others (or even none at all), it's a nice perk because they can really add some variety to the game. On top of that, there are several scenarios also available on the LNOE website for free. I myself have Growing Hunger and Survival of the Fittest. I like how much variety that gives me, so that we can play several games of LNOE in a sitting and not feel like we've plaed the same game over and over.To sum up, I think LNOE is a highly enjoyable, very thematic game. It sees a lot of play with my group, and I'm really glad I gave it a second chance.",5.0,A review from a long time player.,1299628800,"03 9, 2011",Toys_and_Games,1,play LNOE year pretty big variety people play gain lot respect game way play thought gameplay touch briefly basic game concept player play zombie hero board randomly choose L square center board mean layout town little different game game come different scenario outline victory condition help game little different time usually hero player try accomplish specific goal leave town saving townsfolk etc zombie player(s try stop conflict melee range player eliminate game original hero be).component game come board ton mini 14 zombie hero come lot punch chit different thing component durable look great year mini detailed paint card interesting art style base actual picture think great job capture b movie style game theme mention b movie sort game card quote lend horror comedy short game seriously like think gameplay feel consistent theme exception thing pull experience Fun alright far concerned matter game fun firstly game theme conflict turn people like time play LNOE play die zombie die scenario instruction recommend friend consult instruction pretty situation come reqiure specificity scenario play hero defeat certain number zombie time run honest initial reaction absolutely meh die Zombie die feel slow unthematic predictable honest play get copy game Christmas wife course shot pretty clear time people play LNOE generally excited time player game feel lopsided balance somewhat predictable especially use DZD scenario clear people give game second chance get interesting play game begin deep level strategy suspect game interesting close start player feel sure game misblanace zombie player feel like person win time start well win ratio begin balance stand right 50/50 start keep actual record).all think LNOE game play couple time judge familiar game player likely close suspensful game certainly lopsided victory luck demand time luck hear complaint time luck play big role skill LNOE valid statement bad roll attack movement absolutely lose game team add uncertainty suspense game sure frustrate dice way live prefer game little chance element probably game expansion review base game will touch individual expansion feel mention main BGG page LNOE available expansion interested nice perk add variety game scenario available LNOE website free grow Hunger Survival Fittest like variety give play game LNOE sitting feel like plae game sum think LNOE highly enjoyable thematic game see lot play group glad give second chance

The expansion offers new player characters and monster minis. I find the player characters to be a great addition since it adds more options for the players who are pretty low on choices in the first place. The original Mansions offers the PCs very little in the way of choices when it comes to starting out and every little bit helps. If you have a large group they will appreciate the variety since one person won't get stuck playing a character they hate.From my experience the Keeper powers in most of the new stories seem to be better balanced than the original game. I wasn't able to spawn hoards of monsters nearly as fast in most of the new adventures and it gave the players the chance to actually get a little further than they typically would. It is worth noting that the game is still heavily leaning towards the keeper and player victories are hard to come by.The new minis are well done and hold up well, the only complaint I had is 2 of the PC minis were broken off the bases when they arrived but this was quickly fixed with a little super glue I had laying around.Overall the expansion offers great value for the price and having a second box for this game is extremely helpful. I was able to put all the boards and rule books in the original box and then line the minis up on their bases in the new box to avoid them breaking. The height of the new box is actually perfect for the minis to stand up in and the square bases on the monsters means they all fit in the box perfectly.Set up time is as long as ever but I've found its easy to speed this up by separating all of your tokens into bags and labeling them. With the original Arkham Horror I used a tackle box to store all the tokens for quick access and it worked out well. I'll probably eventually do the same for this game.If you really enjoy Mansions other games worth buying are Betrayal at House on the Hill and Arkham Horror.

I've seen this game compared to a combo of Arkham Horror and Pandemic and they are pretty close. What Eldritch Horror does so well is makes the need for investigators to work together much more a requirement if you want to win. There are times when it will be inevitable and necessary for investigators to occupy the same location and tag team monsters or resolve rumors. As time goes by and Mythos cards dwindle and the the Doom track gets closer to 0, panic can set in... Choose your investigators wisely. While some may seem like they don't get to do much (if you are into doing the physical aspects of investigation) you are wrong. Though we didn't use him, Charlie Kane I have to say seems to be the most powerful investigator in the game. While he may not be physical, he can pretty much get the other investigators what they need, and man can that come in handy.The Pros: Lots of Investigators to choose from, the new ability to give away clues loads of new items, spells and artifacts. The addition of Conditions that can hinder your investigator adds new drama to the game.The Cons: Not enough Ancient ones. The game only comes with 4 to choose from (Azathoth, Cthulhu, Shub-Niggurath , and Yog-Sothoth) Now these are great choices but come on!!! where is Nyarlathotep!!! okay that's a personal thing... but I do feel there should be more choices (probably with the expansions, because why wouldn't there be?!?!). The other issue are the Expedition cards. There aren't that many... Each geographic section only comes with 8 and while there are 12 general cards if you have 4+ players you will go through these quickly. The same can be said about the Research cards. In order to gain a clue you have to resolve the Research card for the specific ancient one you are using. While there are 32 cards in total, there are only 8 per Ancient one. This can be crippling. The example is the game I played where the  research card when failed caused the investigators to lose one solved mystery and put it back into the deck. This card came up twice and both times the roll was failed. Which cause the investigators to loose. I hope this is corrected with the expansions by including additional encounter cards for not only new Ancient ones but for the core ones as well...Because of these glaring drawbacks I only give the game 4 stars. But it is still a stellar game and I can't wait to try and beat back the Ancient ones again!!!If you love your Lovecraft (and what rational persons wouldn't???) you NEED THIS GAME!!!",4.0,Race against the Ancient Ones !!!,1388707200,"01 3, 2014",Toys_and_Games,1,word escape incredibly stoke open packaging sniff brand new know game see game compare combo Arkham Horror Pandemic pretty close Eldritch Horror make need investigator work requirement want win time inevitable necessary investigator occupy location tag team monster resolve rumor time go Mythos card dwindle Doom track get close 0 panic set choose investigator wisely like physical aspect investigation wrong use Charlie Kane powerful investigator game physical pretty investigator need man come handy pro lot Investigators choose new ability away clue load new item spell artifact addition condition hinder investigator add new drama game Cons ancient one game come 4 choose Azathoth Cthulhu Shub Niggurath Yog Sothoth great choice come Nyarlathotep okay personal thing feel choice probably expansion issue expedition card geographic section come 8 12 general card 4 + player quickly say Research card order gain clue resolve Research card specific ancient 32 card total 8 ancient crippling example game play   research card failed cause investigator lose solve mystery deck card come twice time roll fail cause investigator loose hope correct expansion include additional encounter card new ancient one core one glare drawback game 4 star stellar game wait try beat ancient one again!!!if love Lovecraft rational person need game

I gotta say, I loved it.The fluff was fantastic, H.P. Lovecraft has a weird relationship with games these days and this one used enough of his work to be fun and interesting without throwing it in your face.The cards and boards (one small one for each player) work well and for the most part seem durable, however, there is no center board and the cards feel a little thinner than I would like.As far as the game-play, it is random enough to be fun, while simple enough to be easy. Sadly, at times it is too random and doesn't have the strategy that Ascension or Dominion would. After a few games it seems that it really is just the luck of who goes first and what cards come up.Sadly, the rules aren't very clear in some areas (specifics on changed effects when the turn order changes and the locker card rulings to be specific {locker cards seem too powerful or useless}).Overall the game was fun, the look and feel of it was great, and while the people I played with didn't have much knowledge on Lovecraft, we all were able to enjoy the art/fluff.

I have been eying an R/C heli for a while but the prices of the good ones were too much for me to jump since I would be a casual user at most, and the cheap ones were too simple and fragile for me.I have to say that these are perfect. the 3ch gives you enough maneuverability to do almost everything you want, but at the same time simplifies things from the more advanced (and much harder to control) expensive helis. These things also have a gyro, which is very rare for helis at this price range, making them very stable in flight, surprisingly stable (according my my friend who sold and repaired expensive helis for a year).These things have a metal frame making them very sturdy but still light. Even so, you can actually buy replaceable parts for these (although you probably wont ever need to buy anything, and unless its the rotors or main shaft that break, you might as well get a new heli). This too is a rarity for this price.These are for indoor flight only, in fact even a small indoor breeze will be reflected in your control of the heli (actually it makes it kinda fun). The s032 is advertised for outdoor flight but I dont know how well that works out for it.Battery last for about 10 minutes and takes 30-40 minutes to charge off of an xbox 360 usb port.Overall these things are fantastic in fun, quality and value.

It is an improv acting game more than a role playing game (although there are tabletop role playing elements in it) wherein you play a character created on the fly with goals and needs, whose relationships will make or break them.This game is wonderful. Even people who traditionally do not play tabletop role playing games can get into Fiasco, simply because it's so unlike any other tabletop game that I've encountered. All play is done through in character discussion and character interaction. There are no dice rolled to decide things in the game, it's based on what you think your character would do and what is being presented to your character.While this seems like it might be a broken system to many people who are used to standard tabletop role playing games, it is not at all. You put yourself into the mindset of another person. If they say something that seems like it would jive with your character, then go with it. If not, then try not to. The key is to remain in character and keep focusing on your goals.This would be the perfect game to introduce people into tabletop role playing, and is also a great game for small gatherings and get-togethers. By the end, it's always interesting to see just how horrible life turned out for your characters - unless they happened to make it big and got away with whatever was going on.But typically, that won't happen. I have introduced a lot of people to this game; a friend of mine who did improvisational acting in a theatre situation actually said that it was so much like improv that it was easy for him to slip into his role without even worrying about how the game is played. There are few rules, other than how dice are handled (they function like points) and your only real rule is to ensure that your character gets what he or she wants.

They simply go slowly forward (most of the time), and you have up/down and left/right.  How I was pleasantly surprised is that this helicopter has a forward/backward control that is integrated into the left/right control--which I didn't know when I purchased it. The up/down control is also nice and it is easy to keep the heli hovered exactly where you want it.My son is 7 years old, and after just a minute of coaching, he was flying it better than me.  Now, he also plays a lot of video games, so that helps.  He was also familiar with the Air Hogs and how to fly those.  Anyways, once he got the hang of it, it was easy for him.I just looked at the price of the Air Hogs Havoc Heli Orange/Grey and it was $28.21.  I bought this New Syma 3 Channel S107 for $32.25.  Only four extra dollars and well worth it--go with this one!The only way they could improve this helicopter is to make the battery last longer.

After swapping his hands and face, you can re-create a scene from the manga in which he holds up a little black cat that's his friend!!! How cute is that?? You can also give him a cool looking face and a hand where he's holding his hair. I currently have Sebastian in regular pose in front of my T.V.

Finally, I decided to treat myself for Christmas.What irks me, for $22 is that the magnets are super cheap and flimsy and the words are on a thin paper that sits on the magnet. A LOT of the words are smeared and most of the words have creases through them where the paper was not lined up properly when it adhered to the magnet. Had I paid $5, I totally would not be complaining about the quality. I guess I really wanted this for so long, that to get a damaged/defective/subpar set stunk.I had looked for a list of the words, but couldn't find one. So here is what I received (I am not going to type all the her/she/I/we/ly and other prepositions): * I will note, after typing them there are quite a few words that may be inappropriate for children/teens and you may want to remove those before allowing kids to use the set.

They loved the puzzle, which is brightly-colored, shiny, and manageable for 3-4 year olds to do mostly on their own.  As with so many of the puzzles I've bought in the past year made by Melissa & Doug, however, the pieces started coming apart after just a few uses.  My kids are not hard on their puzzle pieces at all, we generally do them together, but the shiny top-surface of the pieces of this puzzle start separating on their own (""Mommy, what's wrong with this piece?"").  I glue them back together, let them dry, and then we can use the puzzle again, but it's really annoying.The same thing has happened with the frames of many of the Melissa & Doug wooden puzzles we have--the plywood border of the frame starts to separate from the base, and I have to glue them back together. Overall, these are decent, ultimately disposable puzzles--the floor puzzles are cheaply constructed, the cardboard pieces soon separate and curl.  The wooden ones feel like balsa wood, and the frames soon warp and separate. These puzzles don't have that great feel of real wood puzzles, and though I am one of the most sentimental parents in the world, I have no desire to put one of them aside into the kids' nostalgia childhood boxes; I don't even make the effort to hold onto them for my sister's kids or a friend's kids--the puzzles are out the door to the thrift shop the moment my kids outgrow them.The problem is, I don't see many options.  I'd pay more for puzzles that really held together, but I can't find any great-quality puzzles on Amazon and haven't looked in the really upscale toy/gift shops (regular neighborhood gift stores mainly carry Melissa & Doug).  Cheap puzzles are great, but when you want to give a special gift, or your kid really, really loves puzzles, or it's the activity you do together, hoping you're creating pleasant, life-long memories, or you just have younger kids and want the puzzles to last for them, you may want something nicer, even if it costs more.

Baer,"[23, 23]","With this book, children have the opportunity to join Leap the Frog and his friends on a quest to build a dune buggy that Leap will drive in a dune buggy race.Some notes about what is in the book:1.  Users can choose to have the narrartor's voice read the story aloud, or they can try to read it themselves.  If a reader comes across a word he or she does not know, simply touch the pen to the word, and the narrator will say the word.2.  The book is 24 pages long, and just about every page has an activity that plays a part in helping Leap build the dune buggy and win the race (Oops!  I gave away the ending!).  For example, Leap must find his Grandpa's dune buggy sketch and plan.  The plan is hidden in one of 18 bottles that line 3 shelves.  To help Leap, touch the dune buggy at the bottom of the page.  The narrator says, ""Let's play a game.  Find the orange bottle shaped like a circle.  &lt;reader touches the bottle>  Find the bottle below it.""  If the reader correctly completes the narrator's requests, they are informed by Grandpa, ""You've found it!""  With 3 rows of 6 bottles each, there is a lot of variety - 6 different colors, 3 different shapes.  This was a fairly simple activity that gets the reader's brain geared up for some of the other more challenging activities ahead.3.  I was surprised by how many ""hidden item"" games there were in the story.  Out of the 11 games that I've seen, there were 4 hidden item games.  Readers are given a list and pictures of items to find in the currently viewed page(s).  I didn't think there was much value to these games at first, but my son's attention was held by the activity - a minor miracle considering his short attention span (he was 4 yrs old when he received this book).4.  Other games help with counting money, measuring length, subtraction, and addition.  The actual race is an activity that consists of a maze.  These games are all pretty cool.All in all, I found this worth the money.  It isn't the first book that my son pulls out, but he does flip through it every now and then.  Although the characters are cute, my son dismisses them, because they aren't very memorable (my opinion) which may be because they don't have their own TV shows or other books.  He seems more interested in the Scooby Doo book and the Superman book.

At first I was impressed with it (Great idea) and my son seemed to enjoy it.  But my complaint is with the design of it. (Poor execution) The cartridges seem a little finicky. I often have to wiggle them or the voice tells me I don't have a proper cartridge installed. Where the cartridge is located is too much of a temptation for little hands. He likes to take it out and I inevitably find it under a chair somewhere. The books are difficult to install properly. He always gets interested in the upside down picture on the top half of the book and then he starts pulling at it and soon enough it's unhooked. I don't think a two year old can be expected to reinstall the spirals over the pegs. I have one book in fact (The Foot Book) which just barely fits into the space alotted for it. It sits in there bowed up because it's too wide. (Quality issue?) I agree with another reviewer about the volume - it should stay set at where ever it was during the last use or it should default to a slightly higher setting when you turn it on.To improve this toy I would make the cartridge install underneath, out of plain view and make it so an adult has to do it. The subject matter of the books is geared for an under 3y/o but the operation of the toy seems more suited to an over 3 y/o. Need to change one or the other to get a match. Just make the cartridge and book installation so Mom or Dad haas to do it and then the 2 y/o's can have a ball without needing help when it comes apart.I do want to say though that Leap Frog makes some great toys and this one will not stop us from trying others.",3.0,Great idea - poor execution,1105401600,"01 11, 2005",Toys_and_Games,0,son 2 yrs 9 mos get Christmas relative impressed great idea son enjoy   complaint design poor execution cartridge little finicky wiggle voice tell proper cartridge instal cartridge locate temptation little hand like inevitably find chair book difficult install properly get interested upside picture half book start pull soon unhooked think year old expect reinstall spiral peg book fact Foot Book barely fit space alotte sit bow wide quality issue agree reviewer volume stay set use default slightly high setting turn improve toy cartridge install underneath plain view adult subject matter book gear 3y o operation toy suited 3 y o. need change match cartridge book installation Mom Dad haas 2 y o ball need help come apart want Leap Frog make great toy stop try

Willis,"[1, 2]","My daughter was given this cake for her birthday to go along with other play food toys and a play kitchen she received. She was really excited at first but the reality of having to keep track of all those little pieces has damped it. To make it worse the box has no lid so her younger siblings get into it if it's left out. Like most m&d; sets it would be really nice to have a lid for the box because the box itself is nice but doesn't help keep things neat without a lid.The best part of the set is the cake server, it can be left out and used as a spatula or for serving other play foods.There are a few odd things about the cake itself. The decorations are jelly beans, gumdrops, and strawberries - not really common cake decorations. I agree with another reviewer that frosting flowers would have been a much better and more realistic choice. The slices are wooden and because of the rigidity it is impossible to remove the first slice with the server, it has to be pulled out by hand and the width of the server makes it difficult to 'cut' others because it doesn't fit in the small crack between slices. The candles are made in two attached pieces, the candle and the flame, it would have been more fun if the flame was detachable so the kids could light the candles.My biggest concern, and why this toy cannot be used by my younger children unsupervised, is the paint. Like many of the m&d; products we have owned the paint chips off in big flakes. Even if the company says it does not contain lead I still don't want my kids ingesting it. The paint was chipping within a few hours. I guess I'm just not very comfortable with toys made in china after recent recalls.Overall, I would not have purchased this item but am ok with my kids having been given it. It will stay on a high shelf because of the paint issues and the small parts. The server piece will stay out as long as the paint does not start chipping (it seems to have an extra clear coat, why couldn't they do this on the whole cake?).

Because they think that all board games are more-or-less nothing more than sophisticated versions of Candyland - games which rely on nothing more complicated than random chance.The fact is that random chance doesn't make a very interesting game for adults (unless you're making bets, I suppose), and it doesn't make a very interesting game for children either if they're used to games with more strategy involved. (My young nieces, for example, *will* ask a lot for Candyland - but only because I am not willing to play it with them very often.)Some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children, and that's probably true, but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around, and they know that. I have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like Sleeping Queens or Crazy Eights that I have in Candyland - and, tellingly, when my older niece loses Crazy Eights she pouts and then asks to play again. When she loses Candyland, she pouts and puts the game away!Some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game. But I do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.Instead of Candyland, I'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - Memory, or Froggy Boogie, perhaps.There is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.Edit: I've found out why my niece likes this game at all.

There are not any real game-changing cards here; just some new characters, some new adventure cards, and some alternate endings.  But even being the weakest of the expansions, if you are a Talisman fan then the set is a must-buy.The main change ""Frostmarch"" brings to the game is the concept of Alternate Endings that was so crucial to the original Games Workshop ""Talisman"" board game.  However, instead of giving you the whole batch at once Fantasy Flight has decided to leak a few out with each expansion the same way they are doing with the characters.There are three Alternate Ending cards in ""Frostmarch.""  One, the Warlock's Quest, has to be decided on at the start of the adventure.  It basically replaces the victory conditions, giving each player four Warlock's Quest cards and when the fourth card is complete you get a Talisman and a teleport to the Inner Circle.  This makes for less player-killing, as everyone is trying to complete their quests rather than attacking each other.  The other two Alternate Ending cards are the Crown and Scepter, which is essentially a more deadly version of the Crown of Command, and the Ice Queen, a 12/12 character who makes you lose a few turns if she defeats you.  No Horrible Black Void or Belt of Heracles. Fingers crossed for later expansions.Along with this, there are four new characters, familiar from the original game, like the Leprechaun, some new like the Ogre Chieftain.  I have the same complaint with these as I did with the main game.  I wish they would have a better balance of male/female characters.  So many can be of either gender it seems like they would put more effort there.  As always, the set comes with plastic miniatures of each character. Very cool.As far as the Adventure Cards go, they are a mix of old and new.  There are several ""miss a turn"" -effect monsters which seems to be the theme of ""Frostmarch.""  Get it?  They are frozen so they miss a turn.  More adventure cards are always welcome, and add good variety to the game.I must admit to being VERY disappointed that Fantasy Flight decided to make two Alternate Ending cards available online only.  The Crown of Command card and the Danse Macabre card (for which you needTalisman: Reaper Expansion) are available as print-outs.  This is somewhat in keeping with the spirit of the old Talisman.  I have several cards cut out from White Dwarf magazine.

I purchased nearly every set of available fruits andvegetables for my one- year-old daughter as she is absolutely wild about them.  Of all the sets, this is by far the worst. Cheap plastic, hollow, not to scale, or even on a scale relative to the other pieces.  The colors are horrible, and the detailing is ridiculous.  Most are just colored balls.  The only way this set might be acceptable is if you have a much older child that already knows what all the fruits and veggies are, and can laugh with you over what these are not.  Also, several flaws in the plastic as though it were layed to dry on something, and imperfections in the plastic edges that could be downright dangerous, i.e. sharp or rough.  After spending hours reading review on all the different sets, ordering most of them and being not only dissapointed, but furious that these are marketable, I must say that the Melissa and Doug sets are far, far superior.  They are the most realistic, most durable, and most recognizeable.  My only complaint about them is that there is just not enough of them.

She has been playing with it for several months.  She is not yet at the stage where she is interested in sorting the shapes.  She is a big fan of chewing on them and I've noticed the paint has come off on some of the edges.  She also likes to put one into a plastic cup (from an Ikea staking cup toy) and shake it around, making noise.  Once she started crawling, our little one discovered they quickly slide across the wood floor when she tosses them, and then she loves to retrieve them.  I think she likes that the lid comes off easily, because that's the first thing she removes and chews on.  Then she drops it on the floor, dumps all the blocks out, and chews on them.  Not necessarily its intended purpose!  Some of the blocks are smaller than I'd like and I sometimes fear she may choke on them, but I really don't think that is likely.I suppose that if/when she starts to use it as a shape sorter, she will have to learn to put the shapes that fit into the bottom holes in there first; otherwise, if the bottom of the cube is lined with blocks, you cannot push the star, pentagon, and diamond in (well, maybe a very determined kid could forcefully shove them in and make it work!).  I found that to be potentially frustrating myself because it somewhat takes away the fun of randomness out of inserting the blocks.She (and I) have played with the Fisher Price shape sorter, the plastic one with 4 different shapes (3 pieces of each shape).  That one allowed for less creativity because having only four shapes to sort instead of twelve different ones forces the child to learn that one shape fits one hole.

I didn't know what kind of plastic it was made out of, but it was hard not to wonder about it after noticing the smell.I knew, from the toxic awareness we have today, to look for the small ""recycle"" triangle with the number inside of it and that the numbers you want to stay away from are 3, 6 and 7.Now, because I'm writing this review 4 months after I looked at the number, I cannot remember which number it was, but it WAS one of those three numbers whose plastic does have components that contain ""known potential health risks"". I'm wanting to say it was the number 7, but I just can't remember.Regardless, it was one of the three you don't want to see.Some people argue these warnings. Some say the amount in these plastics isn't enough to cause real harm (although they are saying that they ARE in them, which I just have never understood) or that these chemicals aren't released unless heated (in this case I was going to let my kids play with the Rody outside this summer), but I say, why debate this?

Now having the experience, I would never buy another without gyro stabilization. The earlier model S006 didn't have it. I own one. Here's the facts.Without gyro stabilization, this model is hard to control by comparison. Combined with some frail key plastic parts, like the rotor head, it makes this model very vulnerable to damage. Skilled as I am, I've broken the rotor head and blades several times with landings and collisions other models easily survive. Replacement parts use the same plastic joints. I've milled metal replacements. It works. The upgraded S006 also has a heavier rotor bar. By adding metal fasteners to the end of the bar, it has greatly improved stability. Unfortunately, the added metal increases the weight & vibration, neither of which is good for the model.On take-off, the copter tips. If take-off isn't fast enough, the blades strike the ground.

One problem I found was that it was impossible, for both me and my son, to touch our ear to any of the letters. I used to play Twister as a kid (and this game is an educational twist on Twister, since they have to be able to recognize the alphabet), so I was interested in the physical aspect of the game; however, we had no success with getting our ears to touch the mat. The creators of the game could have limited themselves to hands and feet, or added elbows and knees.The tornado motiv is fun, but the footprints that signal the end of the game seem superfluous to me.All things considered, a fun and educational game.

However, I don't think small toddlers tested this.- It easily tips over (my child thinks it's great to sit on the back.- The shaped &quot;ice cubes&quot; (which is a fantastic idea) fit into any shape hole.  So the square ice cube fits in the round cube hole. (no actually shape sorting going on).- There is only one small shelf in the fridge, which would be fine with me if the bottom were not rounded so things don't stay on it.- Has three &quot;fun&quot; noises and only two of mine have ever worked.- Cute phone but impossible for a toddler to put back.  Ditto with the spoon hook.Some things are good about this.  The opening doors of the stove and cabinet are really great.  At first my child only used the cube dispenser and I thought it was nothing but a very big shape sorter.

However, this is a far-cry from anything magical; potentially causing more ""harm"" than good. Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas for all the right reasons, but this is simply not one of them.To some, ""Elf on the Shelf"" may appear to be a harmless, charming, and ""all-watching"" doll for the fantasy and adoration of children. Remove the ""fantasy and charm"" from the equation, and you've got nothing short of a creepy ""spy"" of sorts. For me, and many others, it is an intimidating symbol for the behavior modification of children; an unwritten ""threat,"" if you will.I must fully concede that in my childhood, I was scared of anything that I believed was ""watching me."" Having read books where animals ""come to life"" is not always a positive one. Sometimes the intent (construed by the child) may be to ""cause harm."" I know that I am not alone in this suggestion, as I've seen similar posts from others. The suggestion to move this figure around the home (or wherever) so that it can ""watch"" the children may be a very scary proposal, and one you might want to discuss before buying.  If my parents had had one of these things when I was in my childhood...I would have absolutely freaked out! No, not in a good way either.From the vast numbers of comments (good and bad) that I've read, it appears that so many proponents of this overly commercialized franchise are using it as a psychological ""tool"" of sorts. Hey, nothing like having a ""spy-cam"" converted into an Elf, right? Whether or not you agree, that is essentially what this thing is doing. And yes, for those of you who wonder if I've even ""read the book?"" I have; cute book -- scary doll.My suggestion to parents boils down to this - talk to your children FIRST! Don't think that this is guaranteed to be received as a ""good surprise"" for the Holiday Season. Some will, and definitely, some won't. The suggestion that this ""Elf"" will make your children ""behave well,"" is just about as misguided as the parents who buy Baby Einstein videos/books; believing their child will be the next child prodigy or Nobel Prize winner - despite the fact there's simply no evidence that they work, much less, ever been tested (which they haven't).If you're that worried about the behavior of your children and what they're up to, invest in a wireless security camera(s). There are also ""Nanny"" programs for the computer, and the list goes on, ad infinitum.As for me, this thing simply puts the ""Creepy"" in ""Christmas.""",1.0,"How about a spy-cam, and get down to business instead?",1354924800,"12 8, 2012",Toys_and_Games,0,problem create little Christmas Magic child far cry magical potentially cause harm good wrong love Christmas right reason simply Elf Shelf appear harmless charming watch doll fantasy adoration child remove fantasy charm equation get short creepy spy sort intimidating symbol behavior modification child unwritten threat fully concede childhood scared believe watch having read book animal come life positive intent construe child cause harm know suggestion see similar post suggestion figure home watch child scary proposal want discuss buying   parent thing childhood absolutely freak good way vast number comment good bad read appear proponent overly commercialize franchise psychological tool sort hey like have spy cam convert Elf right agree essentially thing yes wonder read book cute book scary doll suggestion parent boil talk child think guarantee receive good surprise Holiday Season definitely will suggestion Elf child behave misguided parent buy Baby Einstein video book believe child child prodigy Nobel Prize winner despite fact simply evidence work test haven't).if worried behavior child invest wireless security camera(s nanny program computer list go ad infinitum thing simply put Creepy Christmas

Also, one hand is clearly clenched so that it can grip the sword, but too tightly for you to actually squeeze the sword in. On the other hand, yeah, the fabric colors are totally different from the ones in the picture--which is a good thing, because they're a lot more like the ones on the movie character and not all crazy shades of orange.

The cards have the same wonderful graphics as the original game. They are, however, printed on thin, poorly protected card stock. The original game's cards were about the same quality as a Bicycle card deck--meant to last. These are the equivalent of the cheapest deck of poker cards you'd find at a tourist stop. If the game gets played much at all, especially by younger kids, I imagine the cards may not last very long.2. Only enough score sheets are given to play 4 four-person games. The sheets aren't even scored for easy tear off. I'd photocopy more sheets before playing. If this is what Winning Moves Games expected you to do, the sheets could have been arranged for more economical photocopying.3. The box the game comes in is much larger than necessary. Admittedly,  this is a small detail, but if you plan on traveling with the game much, I'd consider the version Winning Moves sells with newer graphics. The box is about half the size. The tray included in this version is not really necessary for play.On a positive note, 4 cards are included that detail the game's scoring and situational card play.

However, my girls still pull it out now and then and spend a good hour or more playing it.The game is enclosed in the bottom of the box itself.  There are six rubber balls that you put into the game.  Move the box around a bit to be sure no one knows where the balls are located. (The balls are concealed below 3 rows of tiles.) Each player takes turns drawing a card. You must then match that card to one of the tiles (something with 3 items on it, something green, something that is the shape of a circle-etc.) You then ""unlock"" and flip over that tile, hoping to find a ball under it. If you do find a ball, you place that ball in a chute leading to a treasure chest. Once all six balls are found the treasure chest opens and the game starts all over.It does help to teach younger kids their shapes and colors and numbers...I would recommend this game to 3 - 5 year olds.

My husband was complaining about how it attached to the crib, but I didn't pay too much attention to him because I was busy.The next morning at 6:40 my 14 month old daughter crawled to the end of the crib and stood up to try and turn it on like she does with her other musical crib toy (she puts herself back to sleep that way)and she'd barely jiggled the crib and hadn't even touched the machine itself (I was watching her and praying for another 20 minutes of sleep), when it fell off the crib and cracked her right in the head!At first I was mad at my husband; I was sure he'd put it on wrong, or had only half-way secured it.  Once I got my daughter calmed down (she has both a bump and a bruise on her forehead from this toy) I looked it over myself and tried to reattach it.This thing is HAZARDOUS.  The straps are just a piece of plastic crap; they are supposed to slide through the back of the toy, loop over the crib, and hook onto a plastic tab on the back of the strap.  Seriously people, I tried it front ways and backwards, tried attaching it criss-cross, (AFTER following the Vtech instructions on how to attach it) and no matter which way I threaded the straps or how I attached it, it would let go on it's own, or with just the slightest jiggle to the crib.Being 14 months old, my daughter has had her fair share of bumps and bruises already, but I couldn't stop thinking about what if she'd been an infant, and she'd kicked the crib or rolled into it, or I'd bumped it while checking on her and this thing could have plunged the whole distance of the crib to slam into her face/head.I'm really displeased.  These straps are pathetic, ridiculous, and totally unsafe compared to the infant toys we've previously purchased.  The tabs aren't big enough to be secured safely in the openings; they easily move in and out, and half the time won't even stay hooked without any pressure or aggravation.I wanted to return it immediately, but after discussing it with my husband and deciding that our little one does like the toy (when it's not cracking her head) and we do need a musical crib soother still, we decided we'll keep it, BUT I'll be making different, SAFER straps for it myself before it goes back into the crib.",2.0,Watch Out For Falling Objects; This Toy Can Be Dangerous!,1237852800,"03 24, 2009",Toys_and_Games,0,buy Soothe Surprise musical soother crib Grandma house different brand musical soother home   husband complain attach crib pay attention busy morning 6:40 14 month old daughter crawl end crib stand try turn like musical crib toy put sleep way)and barely jiggle crib touch machine watch pray 20 minute sleep fall crib crack right head!at mad husband sure wrong half way secure   get daughter calm bump bruise forehead toy look try reattach thing HAZARDOUS   strap piece plastic crap suppose slide toy loop crib hook plastic tab strap   seriously people try way backwards try attach criss cross follow Vtech instruction attach matter way thread strap attach let slight jiggle crib 14 month old daughter fair share bump bruise stop think infant kick crib roll bump check thing plunge distance crib slam face head i'm displeased   strap pathetic ridiculous totally unsafe compare infant toy previously purchase   tab big secure safely opening easily half time will stay hooked pressure aggravation want return immediately discuss husband decide little like toy crack head need musical crib soother decide make different safer strap go crib

In the meantime, I was just wondering silently how long it would take for us to lose a few of the tiny things, whereas if we did, we'd have to throw the whole game away. Anyway, that was our first impression.As we started the game, I found it very annoying to have to load all the little fruit pieces onto the board, 40 in all. 40 pieces tinier than a marble. And if you take your basket out of the hole, the little fruit pieces will roll into the hole where the basket was and to retrieve it you have to disrupt the entire board and put back all 40 pieces again. That is of course worst case, but it did (and WILL) happen, and was annoying.You spin the spinner and if it lands on a number, you take that many fruits off your tree. If the spinner lands on the dog or bird you give back 2, and if it lands on the spilled basket, you give back everything in your basket.There is a little over a 40% chance that the spinner will land you on one of the spaces where you need to give back your fruits. My poor daughter, through hard luck, kept landing on either the number 1, the dog, or the bird. So whatever little she got, she would have to keep putting it back.This game bored me to tears and worst of all it made my daughter very sad. She did not have a fit but she just had a really sad face every time the spinner landed on the dog or bird.

I love board games, and the packaging and description of this game sold me.  Unfortunately, we were very disappointed and aren't terribly likely to play again.I agree with the other reviewers in one sense: the questions themselves are interesting and kind of fun.  BUT, the rules of the game are unnecessarily complex and, to some extent, flawed.  Also, even though the instructions suggest an alternative for shorter game play, the game is exceedingly long.  (Our game w/4 people took a little over two hours).COMPLEX: On each turn, the active player rolls dice and moves around the board. The player to his left then takes a card and announces a lottery number.  (Players have lottery tickets.)  Then, a question is read.  Each player looks at the answer and then bets whether the active player will get it right or wrong.  Then, the answer is revealed and players either lose their bets or collect their winnings.  Then, if the active player got the question right and landed on an action spot, he or she performs that action.  And if that action results in the player landing on another action spot, he or she performs that action, too.  If he or she got it wrong, he or she puts a ""dinger"" on his or her game piece.  It's a lot of stuff to remember.  Not overwhelming, but it takes a game with a simple premise and buries it beneath some silly details.  We found ourselves forgetting to do the action spots or do the ""dingers"" on occasion.FLAWED: My main complaint about the game is that it's somewhat flawed.  The premise of the game is to bet on players' answers to ""odds are"" questions.  BUT, at the end of the game, the winner will almost certainly be determined by who won the most lotteries and/or who crossed the finish line first -- regardless of how he or she did answering questions and/or betting on others' answers.  The lottery pool, which ""collects"" all of the incorrect wagers, gets HUGE.  It's disproportionately large, compared to the money that changes hands on a typical question.  So, the real strategy, if you can call it that, is to win the lottery.  Your game skills really have little to do with it.  When we played, the winner was the person who won the lottery twice.  Our second place winner was the person who crossed the finish line first, which also results in a lottery win.You might ask, what's wrong with the person who crosses the finish line first winning -- or, in our case, almost winning?  Well, moving around the board has very little to do with your ability to answer questions.  You roll the dice and move BEFORE you even hear the question.It's a great looking game -- but for us, it was a big miss.",2.0,Disappointed,1081814400,"04 13, 2004",Toys_and_Games,0,ask game birthday present get   love board game packaging description game sell   unfortunately disappointed terribly likely play agree reviewer sense question interesting kind fun   rule game unnecessarily complex extent flawed   instruction suggest alternative short game play game exceedingly long   game w/4 people take little hours).COMPLEX turn active player roll dice move board player left take card announce lottery number   player lottery ticket   question read   player look answer bet active player right wrong   answer reveal player lose bet collect winning   active player get question right land action spot perform action   action result player land action spot perform action   get wrong put dinger game piece   lot stuff remember   overwhelming take game simple premise bury beneath silly detail   find forget action spot dinger occasion flawed main complaint game somewhat flawed   premise game bet player answer odd question   end game winner certainly determine win lottery and/or cross finish line regardless answer question and/or bet answer   lottery pool collect incorrect wager get huge   disproportionately large compare money change hand typical question   real strategy win lottery   game skill little   play winner person win lottery twice   second place winner person cross finish line result lottery win ask wrong person cross finish line win case win   move board little ability answer question   roll dice hear question great look game big miss

That includes my wife and me along with our four children ages 7 to 10 (twin boys in there).  We greatly enjoyed the original DC Comics Deck-building Game and played it so often we had to get card sleeves to protect the cards from disintegrating.  Once we found out an expansion was planned, the kids would ask every day if it was out yet.  Unfortunately that enthusiasm for the game was quickly dampened once we received the game.  I understand the game is rated for 15+ and it is more than warranted given the somewhat graphic images DC choose for the artwork.  The kids, especially my daughter, were looking forward to Starfire playing a more prominent role in this version of the game, but her barely there outfit made the kids want to throw her cards away.  The artwork is great for any teen or adult male, but DC seemed to have missed the fact most reviews of the original DC Comics Game were written by women and people with families that greatly enjoyed the game (yes, there is some questionable art in the first game, but it is generally unnoticeable by the younger players).Getting past the artwork, the game play is only vaguely similar to the original.  Yes, you still accumulated power which can be used to buy/defeat the lineup & super villains, but the new main deck cards are so unbalanced that the deft strategy and thinking that made the original game great has been replaced by pure luck.  If a player happens to have their turn and enough power in their hand when certain cards come out, the game is essentially over since they will be able to dominate the game.  Where you always that you had a chance in the original game, and that was one of the most enjoyable things about it, playing Heroes Unite, you can often tell who is going to win before the game is half over.Heroes Unite is, unfortunately, an unplayable mess of a game.  The focus of Heroes Unite is to do everything you can to punish your opponents.  You are rewarded for being ruthless and as unkind as possible.  While this may appeal to some players, it does not reflect in any way the appeal of the original DC Comics Deck-building Game.  No matter how many times you play, each game will go the same way.  One person will be the lucky recipient and win without be contested.  There will be little the other players can do to prevent the onslaught since the game boils down to who happened to be the lucky player.  The rest of the players will struggle their way through without any of the fun and enjoyment the original DC Comic Deck-building Game has.Perhaps the worst thing I can say about the game is that even when you win there is no joy or satisfaction for doing so.  9 times out 10 a person will achieve victory by being in the right place at the right time without any of their decisions or actions actually helping them to win the game.",2.0,Never fix something that isn't broken,1399248000,"05 5, 2014",Toys_and_Games,0,note play DC Comics Deck building game family   include wife child age 7 10 twin boy   greatly enjoy original DC Comics Deck building Game play card sleeve protect card disintegrate   find expansion plan kid ask day   unfortunately enthusiasm game quickly dampen receive game   understand game rate 15 + warrant give somewhat graphic image DC choose artwork   kid especially daughter look forward Starfire play prominent role version game barely outfit kid want throw card away   artwork great teen adult male DC miss fact review original DC Comics Game write woman people family greatly enjoy game yes questionable art game generally unnoticeable young players).gette past artwork game play vaguely similar original   yes accumulate power buy defeat lineup super villain new main deck card unbalanced deft strategy thinking original game great replace pure luck   player happen turn power hand certain card come game essentially able dominate game   chance original game enjoyable thing play Heroes Unite tell go win game half Heroes Unite unfortunately unplayable mess game   focus Heroes Unite punish opponent   reward ruthless unkind possible   appeal player reflect way appeal original DC Comics Deck building Game   matter time play game way   person lucky recipient win contest   little player prevent onslaught game boil happen lucky player   rest player struggle way fun enjoyment original DC Comic Deck building Game bad thing game win joy satisfaction   9 time 10 person achieve victory right place right time decision action actually help win game

When I opened the box, I noticed an odd smell. Later, when I removed the wheels from their packaging I was hit by an awful ofgassing odor, which seemed to emanate from the tires. As I continued to assemble the vehicle, I started to get a headache and realized that the odors were the source of my headache and discomfort. The smell did not dissipate. Every time I walked near the roadster the offensive smell continued to bother me to the point where I could not let my son near the vehicle. If it weren't raining, we would have put it outside. Instead, we have it in a bathroom with the exahust fan on.

Once our product is manufactured it is instantly packaged and the rubber smell of the tire is trapped inside. We advise our consumers to wipe down the wheels with hot soapy water and leave outside or in a garage over night. The smell will then dissapate for you. We could send you out replacement wheels, however we would follow this same procedure with the replacement wheels in house before we send them out to you......While the included directions did not offer this information, they recommend you wash the tires with soapy water and leave outside over night. If you live in an apartment building, this may not be so easy. Still, the fumes were overwhelming, and I simply don't believe that the fumes which gave me a headache are ""safe"".

It sounded like a cute little game that would build up the kitty's anticipation for Christmas. A simple game where the parent hides the elf around the house and the kid looks for it in the morning. The legend is that the elf spies on the kid, and then reports back to Santa every night. Not only did it sound fun, but it was one more way to black mail the little turds into being good around the holidays. Well worth the price of 24 bucks...or so I thought.Well, things started out as you could expect. I would come home in the evening and tell the kids to grab me a beer while I would sit down to watch TV. They would ignore me, an act that usually resulted with me yelling, and throwing my shoes at them, but with the magic of Christmas in the air, and Pedro on the shelf (the name given to our elf by the kids) my frosty malted beverage would find its way to my hand within a minute. Just when I was really starting to like the novelty (although I was still a little piffed as to why our version turned out to be a Puerto Rican elf), things took a turn for the worse.It started when my daughter asked me one night why the elf liked to spy on her. I told her that it was because he would let Santa know whenever she was naughty. She asked what that meant, and I proceeded to explain to her that it meant that he would basically rat her out whenever she did something bad, like wet the bed. Well as luck would have it, that very night she had a little ""accident"", and because she was afraid that the elf would tell on her, she decided to hide the soiled sheet under her bed. Well about a week later the whole room wreaked of urine and tears. That was strike one for the elf.The second strike came one morning when the kiddos were looking for the sneaky little guy. I had hid itThe night before, but by this time I had a little game of my own going on. See, I would get all crazy on wine and pain killers whenever I would hide it, that way it was a game for me to find it in the morning myself! A little way to bring some holiday magic for myself as well. Anyway, after about an hour and a half the elf was still MIA, and I had lost interest in ever finding the little SOB again. As many will agree, children are much more persistent than adults when it comes to these things, so they were still going strong trying to find the little man. It finally got to the point where I couldn't take it any longer and I howled out that Christmas was make believe, Santa was fake, the elf was a hoax, and there was no Jesus. Well they all start crying, and only stopped when they found the elf five minutes later. I had placed it in a provocative position with one of the dogs squeaky toys. I had to answer a lot of questions about the birds and the bees for the next several hours. About the least desirable thing to do when your nursing one heck of a hangover, I'll tell you that much. They were finally satisfied that old Pedro probably had a little too much tequila the night before, and had decided to find himself an unclean lady of the night. Strike two.The third and final strike occurred when they decided to play elf on the shelf one day after school. My eldest was going to play the part of the elf, while the youngest of my brood was going to play herself (not creative in the least but what do you expect from a kid that hides her urine soaked sheets under the bed). Well, while the old one was looking for a good hiding spot, he ended up coming across my stash of Asian fetish porn. Apparently he found something he liked because I find him in the closet all the time looking at the magazines. Sick little pervert.

Plus the price was great.You start with one character, recruit more depending on the areas you visit, and fight off monsters in order to acquire cards that might give some or all of your characters an advantage for the next round.  Pretty easy rules, and you can make the game easier by removing the tougher ""Final Mission"" and just complete both of your normal missions.  Great artwork, and the quality textured cards will last awhile without buying sleeves for everything.Winning the game involves more luck than a card game like Citadels or Colossal Arena.  Frequently rolling dice for status checks and attack power makes the game feel a lot like an actual RPG.  Some players will really like this.  I don't play many RPGs, so it can get a little frustrating to have a great strategy foiled by a bad roll of the dice.  Also, the area cards (which are played face-up and left on the table to be used by anyone) have a lot of really small lettering on them.  It's a minor inconvenience to have to keep picking it up off the table because the type is too small to read from my chair without squinting.

Simply put, the Skywinder is a very unresponsive and unrealistic model airplane.  The twin-engine steering system is almost worthless.

My Skywinder has gotten away from me more times than it has made a controlled landing.  Yes, the Skywinder can do loops and other aerobatics, but the lack of true rudder control makes this thing more like a freeflight model than anything.  It's like trying to drive a car with no steering wheel.If the Air Hogs company would learn some basic airplane fundamentals, they would put a rudder control on the Skywinder and then they'd have a real winner.  The Skywinder flies fast and is powerful, and has good pitch (up/down) control, but the very poor lack of steering (yaw) control makes it get away from you in a hurry and you end up watching it spiral nose-first into the ground off in the distance.For a more authentic and much more controllable flight, you should purchase the 'rush' model which has true rudder control.

The issue with the ladybug that many reviewers have mentioned no longer seems to be a problem; at least on our board it slides back and forth easily and my son has no problem with it.  It erases in both directions, and there's no loud grinding noise or anything.My pet peeve is with the magnetic stamps.  They are so tightly wedged into the board that my son can't remove them on his own, and they are hard for even me to get out unless I pull on them exactly the right way.  Further proving the point, we took this toy to my parents' house over Thanksgiving, and my son tried to play with it with them one evening while my husband and I were out.  Not knowing that the animal shapes at the top were removable, my parents tugged on them a bit and finally gave up, deciding that they weren't meant to be removed.  It seems to me that in a toy designed for 2-year-olds, they could have come up with a method of magnet storage that the kids could manipulate on their own -- for example, having the top be magnetic so that the magnets would 'stick' in their appropriate spots, without being gripped so hard that they can't be removed.That said, my son does enjoy this toy.  He likes to scribble with the pen and play with the shapes the magnets make.Update 12/9/2010:  My son is now a couple months short of 4 years old, and he still enjoys this toy.  We take it with us on car trips and doctor visits and other errands that require waiting, and it entertains him for a good while (both with and without parent interaction).

It's definitely better than even the CD Second  Edition in terms of the number, variety, and level-appropriateness of  questions.  The questions much more closely approximate those on the  television series than either of the two CD-ROMs. And the Phone-a-Friend  lifeline is much closer to the show in that you actually CAN phone a  friend, unlike on the CD-ROM.Where the board game fails is in the  implementation of the other lifelines and in its dumbfounding lack of  music.The 50/50 doesn't particularly work.  On the show, it's  effective because Regis himself has no control over anything, and because  the player's ramblings appear to determine which responses are pulled.  Here,  the person playing host potentially has too much leeway in deciding  which choices will be nixed.  To be fair, the CD-ROM isn't much better at  capturing the actual feel of this lifeline, either--its throwaways are  predetermined by code--but its approximation is at least fairer.Similarly, the Poll-the-Audience option fails miserably.  Instead of  being a more-or-less sure bet, this lifeline depends entirely on the  benevolence of the people you're playing against.  There's no ""audience"" in  this game, because everyone's a player.  It's in their interest to mislead  the person currently in the hot seat.  Consequently, you'll likely get the  wrong answer if you choose this lifeline-which goes against everything we  learn from watching the show.But the biggest drawback of this edition is  the lack of music.  The show is entirely built around the music.  Without  music, Millionaire is nothing special.  The music is the origin of 90% of  the drama.  A CD with the theme music should absolutely have been  included.On balance, the Second Edition of the CD-ROM game wins out over  this one because you're just not going to have so many Millionaire-themed  parties that it will matter that this version has slightly more questions.  You might as well get the version that comes closest to approximating the  overall experience of the real deal.

If your family does not include any children under 10 or so you may want to try another game. The rules are overly simplistic and the gameplay depends entirely on the dice - there is very little strategy. The outcomes of each round vary wildly (including a 1-in-12 chance on *every* monster attack that you will lose all of your treasure and have to start over from the very beginning) and there are very few ways to influence the game through skill or strategy.I purchased this taking a chance that it might be a fun addition to a game night among adults but unfortunately it is not.Also, the game itself is frustrating because there are numerous cards you must keep separated: 6 stacks of treasure cards, 6 stacks of monster cards, and 3 stacks of spell cards. All of these cards are smaller than business cards and even more flimsy. There are not enough of each type to shuffle properly, but you have to mix them before each game - that is 15 stacks of tiny, thin cards you need to mix up with your big clunky adult-sized human hands every game. It quickly becomes annoying.As another reviewer mentioned, the usage of the ""Cleared"" tokens is also frustrating. The rooms on the board are quite small and each one requires a token once cleared; a slight bump and they all scatter out of place. In addition, if you roll the dice on the board, you risk knocking over one of many tokens or stand-ups that might be carefully positioned.Clearly this game was designed with kids in mind, which is great, but it's unfortunate that so many online reviews seem to say it's fun for adults.

It is shameful to even waste trash bin space on this one. Seriously. Yes, it really IS that bad.1) Chinese Checkers: The board size -- at 11-1/2 inches diameter -- is ridiculously small, which renders it frustrating to all parties of all ages who attempt to play. It is next-to-impossible for even the most adroit and nimble-fingered adult to play. And even our children at ages 6 and 7, with their teeny tiny fingers, cannot move one ball one space anywhere on the board without disrupting at least a dozen other balls and sending them scattering to the four corners of the Earth. And believe me, this has nothing to do with motor skills or eye-hand coordination!2) Chinese Checkers: This set does NOT utilize real glass marbles which look aesthetically pleasing in their soft pearlized hues and feel pleasantly organic to the touch. Oh no. Rather this set comes with cheap, pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" in obnoxious primary colors. The pathetic plasticness of these ""balls"" renders them utterly useless for anything other than annoyingly rolling to the four corners of the Earth -- at every touch, turn, hiccup, and/or breath!3) Chinese Checkers: The holes are not set deep enough into the board; therefore, the pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" proceed to roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth every time someone even minimally touches the playing table, board, or any marble on the board. In fact, if anyone even closes a door in the house, turns on the radio, or a car backfires in the street, all of the pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" on the board WILL indeed roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth.4) Checkers: First, the checkers are about the size of Sweet Tarts and trying to play the game on a board this small will nearly drive you mad. Second, the checkers will not stack and stay put when it comes time to ""king"" someone. Third, there is something about the sound of plastic checkers banging down in repeated movements on a tin board that is akin to nails on a chalkboard in the realm of one's auditory sense. And last but certainly not least, similar to the Chinese Checkers side of this maddening duo, if you can move your checkers on this eensy board without disrupting every other checker on the board and sending them sliding toward the four corners of the Earth, well, you have some mad playing skills that no one who has entered our home of any age, gender, race or religion -- be it man, woman or child -- can master!5) Storage: The pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" and maddeningly unstackable checkers cannot be sandwiched for storage inside of this two-sided tin (even though this is touted as a ""feature"" of the product) when/if kept in the nylon netted bags in which they come. We had to separate ""balls"" and checkers out into several ziploc baggies in order to spread them out in a ""thin enough"" layer to actually get the tin to stay sandwiched closed. So essentially, we had to repackage all the playing pieces immediately in order to simply get the tin to stay closed for storage in between play sessions.Bottom Line: This set is ill-conceived and poorly executed on so many different levels it's appalling. ""Cheap junk"" is the best thing I can say about it. My mother bought it locally for twice the price it is here on Amazon as a Valentine's gift for our children. Within three days, they were frustrated beyond measure, and my husband and I went online looking for something better.For a good quality, aesthetically pleasing, useable, properly-sized Chinese Checkers set at a reasonable price, please consider the **15"" JUMBO CHINESE CHECKERS WITH MARBLES BY CHH** here on Amazon.

Sadly, I was just not able to.  The production quality is top-notch, and up to FFG's very high standards.  However, the game play was rather random.Basically one:Draws a tile or explores a space at which point they may fight a monster.  While the dungeon rooms are all inspired, there are many tiles that can spell instant death to your character (putting you out of the game) or require a skill roll - this being a simple mechanic that works rather well.  Fighting monsters on the other hand is an entirely different story.  Combat is essentially a card game, and while each character and monster may influence the composition of their ""hand"" with a single card draw, that is the only time the character itself influences combat in any way.  That is, character stats / abilities do not come into play in combat.  Combat uses a card deck that a hand is drawn from (except the one card from the characters cards) and then hands are refreshed form the combat deck until combat is over.  While this is an interesting mechanic, it was a bit disappointing that my elf archer could not choose ranged tactics, or decide to close to ranged, etc.This game is also not cooperative play - each player starts in a separate corner.  This is not entirely bad, but anyone expecting Descent or Warhammer Quest will be severely disappointed. While I was not necessarily looking for similarities, I was expecting at least some RPG similarities.If you are looking for a very simple, usually quick game (death can come fast and furious - last one standing is a good thing, if you can escape) then this may be the game for you.

However it is a calculator that will not shut off and lose your life point total during a game.

It is shameful to even waste trash bin space on this one. Seriously. Yes, it really IS that bad.1) Chinese Checkers: The board size -- at 11-1/2 inches diameter -- is ridiculously small, which renders it frustrating to all parties of all ages who attempt to play. It is next-to-impossible for even the most adroit and nimble-fingered adult to play. And even our children at ages 6 and 7, with their teeny tiny fingers, cannot move one ball one space anywhere on the board without disrupting at least a dozen other balls and sending them scattering to the four corners of the Earth. And believe me, this has nothing to do with motor skills or eye-hand coordination!2) Chinese Checkers: This set does NOT utilize real glass marbles which look aesthetically pleasing in their soft pearlized hues and feel pleasantly organic to the touch. Oh no. Rather this set comes with cheap, pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" in obnoxious primary colors. The pathetic plasticness of these ""balls"" renders them utterly useless for anything other than annoyingly rolling to the four corners of the Earth -- at every touch, turn, hiccup, and/or breath!3) Chinese Checkers: The holes are not set deep enough into the board; therefore, the pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" proceed to roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth every time someone even minimally touches the playing table, board, or any marble on the board. In fact, if anyone even closes a door in the house, turns on the radio, or a car backfires in the street, all of the pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" on the board WILL indeed roll annoyingly to the four corners of the Earth.4) Checkers: First, the checkers are about the size of Sweet Tarts and trying to play the game on a board this small will nearly drive you mad. Second, the checkers will not stack and stay put when it comes time to ""king"" someone. Third, there is something about the sound of plastic checkers banging down in repeated movements on a tin board that is akin to nails on a chalkboard in the realm of one's auditory sense. And last but certainly not least, similar to the Chinese Checkers side of this maddening duo, if you can move your checkers on this eensy board without disrupting every other checker on the board and sending them sliding toward the four corners of the Earth, well, you have some mad playing skills that no one who has entered our home of any age, gender, race or religion -- be it man, woman or child -- can master!5) Storage: The pathetic little lightweight plastic ""balls"" and maddeningly unstackable checkers cannot be sandwiched for storage inside of this two-sided tin (even though this is touted as a ""feature"" of the product) when/if kept in the nylon netted bags in which they come. We had to separate ""balls"" and checkers out into several ziploc baggies in order to spread them out in a ""thin enough"" layer to actually get the tin to stay sandwiched closed. So essentially, we had to repackage all the playing pieces immediately in order to simply get the tin to stay closed for storage in between play sessions.Bottom Line: This set is ill-conceived and poorly executed on so many different levels it's appalling. ""Cheap junk"" is the best thing I can say about it. My mother bought it locally for twice the price it is here on Amazon as a Valentine's gift for our children. Within three days, they were frustrated beyond measure, and my husband and I went online looking for something better.For a good quality, aesthetically pleasing, useable, properly-sized Chinese Checkers set at a reasonable price, please consider the **15"" JUMBO CHINESE CHECKERS WITH MARBLES BY CHH** here on Amazon.

The air filled tires do make for a comfy ride and smooth to pull, though the handle is still too short for me, and I'm only average height. The wagon is a bit on the narrow side.  It's barely wide enough for a toddler, but not wide enough to haul a medium size pumpkin. The bonus is, the rails are easily removable.  Now that I've discussed the pros, here's a huge con that makes me pretty much regret purchasing this wagon. While the air filled tires seem like a great idea, it is not if you were to ever come across thorns. We took the wagon with us to a farm once to pick berries. You would think...All-Terrain, farm, mud, grass, dirt...should be fine, right? When we came home, we discovered the tires had a bunch of sticker thorns stuck in them from raspberry bushes. We're not talking heavy duty thorns, and it's not like we dragged the wagon through puncture spikes intended for escaping criminals, just your average thorn that you might find in your bike tire after a typical ride...thorns that puncture resistant inner tubes on my bike have survived just fine. That pretty much rendered the entire wagon useless because the tires do not have inner tubes. Once you get a thorn in, it's a goner. You can't patch the holes.  We've tried to re-fill the tires with air numerous times just to have them leak out to flat in a matter of 30 minutes.  I've scoured the internet for reasonably priced solutions and the only thing I could come up with was to replace all four tires, which you can order from Radio Flyer's website. Here's the kicker: tires are sold individually and currently they go for over $26. $26 x 4 tires = $104 and that's not even including tax and shipping and handling!  For $104 I'm better off buying a new wagon, one without inflatable tires. So here I am, stuck with what used to be a great wagon...with flat wheels that are not practical to replace.

{'$oid': '5a13282c741a2384e879dcc1'},AB3GJ41FTGR3S,1589942108,,"[12, 27]","First of all, I always wanted to play this game and was thrilled when a member of our game night group decided to purchase and learn how to play it, as to teach the rest of us.  That is the only positive thing I can say about the experience.  We played a competitive game with 7 people, and all I can say was that after the first hour of 5 and 1/2 hours of play most of us were trying to figure out how to kill our characters off so we could stop the game and lose.  Unfortunately, like the horror that it is, it will not let you do that because the weaker you get, the weaker the games monsters get.  I don't know if that is an intentional mechanic of the game or just the way it turned out for our play, but it seems the game is determined to make you go through the hell of playing for the entire night and most of the next morning just to get it over with.  We started at 9 p.m. and did not finish (and we actually beat the game mind you) until 4 a.m. the next morning; and remember we already had a person who knew how to play leading us through, so it was not like we spent hours setting up and getting started, that actually only took about 45 min. (which, is in my opinion a deal breaker for any game, set up should be easy and take no more than 5-10 min., max, if you know how to play, 20-30 min. max for first time), the rule book alone is almost 30 pages long and don't expect a quick start or ""idiots"" guide to help it get moving, cuz there aint one.  This game is so convoluted and without plot that building any kind of strategy is pointless, and there is no real storyline to get into or pass the time.  Most of the time, whenever you do face something, it will knock you down to almost nothing before you even get a chance to fight it, so you are unlikely to be successful, most of the locations on the game require funds and achievements that take hours to get in order to get what the site offers.  The mechanics are so flawed/boring that most of the time the players are sitting in the ""Nether Regions"" twiddling their thumbs for 30-45 minutes (usually two or more rounds), waiting to get to do something because their character has been ""KO'd"" or they are attempting to close a gate.  The end was very anti-climatic and occurred with little action or fan fair.  If you think this game looks like fun I would suggest finding someone else who has it and play it with them first before you spend the money, or purchase A Touch of Evil from Flying Frogs productions which is this same basic game with all of the stupid, repetitive, boring, pointless, convolutions and bad mechanics removed and therefor much more fun to play and far less time consuming.  I mean really, 5.5 hours?  I would not want to play my favorite game of all time (which is a Flying Frog game by the way, Fortune and Glory) for 5.5 hours.  The board in this game is too large and the writing is too small, so you spend half the night standing up looking over the shoulder of your fellow gamers, trying to read what occurs at each location, to figure out if it is worth traveling to that site.  The board is also very non-descript and unattractive and you better have a very large table to play it on because there is a lot of crap that needs to be on the table at one time for this game, I can not even imagine how large and drug out the expansions for this game would make it.  Again, my advice would be let someone else sport the bill for this one and play with them or get A Touch of Evil instead if you want a fun night of gaming.  But, if you enjoy wishing you could have the last 5.5 hours of your life back after the fact, and I guess there is some Lovecraftian masochism to that, than by all means ignore my recommendation and purchase this game.  If you are a diehard Lovecraft fan and just love anything that has to do with the Cthulhu mythos, no matter how entertaining it is, or isn't, than I suppose you might like this game; only one person in our group falls into the category of that big of Lovecraft fan, so we do not.  As a last thought, just to let you know, our group is a hardcore gaming group, that plays everything from D&D to Clue, so it is not the fact that we are not up to games of this magnitude, in fact we love convoluted and complicated, as long as it is fun and has a purpose beyond just being convoluted and complicated, this game is and does neither.",1.0,Should have been called Boredom Horror: The Call of Deep Sleep,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",Toys_and_Games,0,want play game thrill member game night group decide purchase learn play teach rest   positive thing experience   play competitive game 7 people hour 5 1/2 hour play try figure kill character stop game lose   unfortunately like horror let weak weak game monster   know intentional mechanic game way turn play game determined hell play entire night morning   start 9 p.m. finish actually beat game mind 4 a.m. morning remember person know play lead like spend hour set getting start actually take 45 min opinion deal breaker game set easy 5 10 min max know play 20 30 min max time rule book 30 page long expect quick start idiot guide help move cuz be not   game convoluted plot build kind strategy pointless real storyline pass time   time face knock chance fight unlikely successful location game require fund achievement hour order site offer   mechanic flawed boring time player sit Nether Regions twiddle thumb 30 45 minute usually round wait character KO'd attempt close gate   end anti climatic occur little action fan fair   think game look like fun suggest find play spend money purchase touch Evil Flying Frogs production basic game stupid repetitive boring pointless convolution bad mechanic remove therefor fun play far time consume   mean 5.5 hour   want play favorite game time Flying Frog game way Fortune Glory 5.5 hour   board game large writing small spend half night stand look shoulder fellow gamer try read occur location figure worth travel site   board non descript unattractive well large table play lot crap need table time game imagine large drug expansion game   advice let sport bill play touch Evil instead want fun night gaming   enjoy wish 5.5 hour life fact guess lovecraftian masochism mean ignore recommendation purchase game   diehard Lovecraft fan love cthulhu mythos matter entertaining suppose like game person group fall category big Lovecraft fan   thought let know group hardcore gaming group play D&D Clue fact game magnitude fact love convoluted complicated long fun purpose convoluted complicated game

This is not a toy made for children with somewhat of a rowdy nature- it can be toppled over and collapsed onto the floor in the blink of an eye. However, I must say- it is well made as it has withstood much horseplay and it is still just like brand new. The only plastic article about this tent is the inflatable steering wheel- the rest is fabric which wipes off easily for clean up. The main thing I would change is that it would be sturdier and less easy to turn over and collapse. For my boys, they something a bit more attention grabbing with more activity variety. Overall, not bad for the price. I plan on getting them a larger play hut for thier 3rd birthday with tunnels and a ball pit and think that will be more suitable for thier nature.

{'$oid': '5a132833741a2384e87c682d'},A2POYXTGSPSW7O,B0000DEW8G,Bill Hensler,"[18, 21]","Lots of boys over the ages have built this model.  There seems to be a dividing line.  There are the kids who build it.  The kit is fine for them.  There are not many peices, those are large, the instructions are easy to follow, and a fair kit can be made.  Next, the kit is cheap at this point, at less than twenty dollars and that includes shipping.,Now, for the adults.  First, surf over to steelnavy(dot)com and look at their builds.  This kit isn't that bad but some things will have to be fixed.  I would toss all the .50 caliber guns away and get new ones.  Second, if you're building this model as JFK's boat then you're going to need to get a 1/72 scale 37mm anti-tank gun, remove the wheels, get some small wooden blocks, and put it on the bow of the boat.  Hasegawa makes the US Army 37mm gun and those can be purchased at ebay . com.  Amazon does not have them else I would have given you a product link to the site.  Also, Squadron(dot)com might have the US Army's 37 mm gun.  But if you're an adult you'll want to do the boat right and PT-109 did have an anti-tank gun on the front.This model by Revell can be converted into most of the typical Elco boats of WWII.  If you want to build it as an Pacific Barge Buster then surf over to H R products (Google key words:  H R ship fittings).  In the 1/72 scale section they sell the complete sets of 37mm aircraft guns (not the same as the anti tank gun; that 37 mm gun was an automatic cannon pulled from P-39 fighter aircraft) and the 40mm Bofors anti-aircraft gun.  Also, H R sells better .50 caliber machine guns (so does Squadron or anybody else for that matter).  Last, H R sells the rack mounted torpedos used on PT boats in the post 1943 period.  DO NOT TOSS away the 20mm gun if building a barge buster.  The Bofors goes where the 20mm was mounted and that gun is moved to the front by the automatic 37mm gun.  An Elco PT modified as a barge buster is a fast, torpedo armed gun boat.  This kit is perfect for the conversion having thick plastic and general details that just welcome the scratch builder.Honestly, I like this kit and have built several over the years.  It can be built as a simple mid-war PT boat or as a small barge-busting gun boat that wrecked a lot of Japanese Barge shipping in the late '44 to '45 period.  Additionally, the Elco boats were used in the European War, around Italy, and they fought more than a few night missions with the extremely good German S-boots (German S-100 Fast Attack Boat w/Flak 38 by Revell Germany), a torpedo boat more than a match for a single PT.  Yes, our guys usually won; there were lots of very deadly nights in the seas off the Italian coast from 1943 to 1945.I wish Revell would update the kit.  But for the time being it's cheap.  That is good for the kids.  Since the adults will want to seriously improve this model the inexpensive price is good because it allows several purchases.  It allows us to spend serious money at the other sites on after market supplies.  No two PT boats were really standard by post 1944 and it's just as well the PT-109 kit comes to us ""standard"" because no two looked the same in the Navy after a few months in service.Here is a good reference at Amazon:US Patrol Torpedo Boats: World War II (New Vanguard)Note the gunboat version, mid-Pacific war, and European War verions and the difference in the paint.Trivia:  the Pacific tropic weather was hard on the PTs, the vast majority had deck rot or plywood delamination by '46, and the fleet was pretty much all burned.  Few survived past '47.  Ironically, more of the real PT-109 exists than most of the fleet:  http : // news . nationalgeographic.com / news / 2002 / 07 / 0709_020710_kennedyPT109 . htmlBest of luck with your build.",3.0,Not bad for a 50 year old model,1309478400,"07 1, 2011",Toys_and_Games,0,"lot boy age build model   divide line   kid build   kit fine   peice large instruction easy follow fair kit   kit cheap point dollar include shipping ,Now adult   surf steelnavy(dot)com look build   kit bad thing fix   toss .50 caliber gun away new one   second build model JFK boat go need 1/72 scale 37 mm anti tank gun remove wheel small wooden block bow boat   Hasegawa make Army 37 mm gun purchase ebay com   Amazon give product link site   squadron(dot)com Army 37 mm gun   adult want boat right PT-109 anti tank gun model Revell convert typical Elco boat WWII   want build Pacific Barge Buster surf H r product Google key word   H R ship fitting   1/72 scale section sell complete set 37 mm aircraft gun anti tank gun 37 mm gun automatic cannon pull P-39 fighter aircraft 40 mm Bofors anti aircraft gun   H R sell well .50 caliber machine gun Squadron anybody matter   H R sell rack mount torpedo PT boat post 1943 period   toss away 20 mm gun build barge buster   Bofors go 20 mm mount gun move automatic 37 mm gun   Elco PT modify barge buster fast torpedo armed gun boat   kit perfect conversion have thick plastic general detail welcome scratch builder honestly like kit build year   build simple mid war PT boat small barge bust gun boat wreck lot japanese Barge shipping late 44 45 period   additionally Elco boat European War Italy fight night mission extremely good german s boot German S-100 Fast Attack Boat w Flak 38 Revell Germany torpedo boat match single PT   yes guy usually win lot deadly night sea italian coast 1943 1945.i wish Revell update kit   time cheap   good kid   adult want seriously improve model inexpensive price good allow purchase   allow spend money site market supply   PT boat standard post 1944 PT-109 kit come standard look Navy month service good reference Amazon Patrol Torpedo Boats World War II new vanguard)note gunboat version mid pacific war European War verion difference paint trivium   Pacific tropic weather hard pt vast majority deck rot plywood delamination 46 fleet pretty burn   survive past 47   ironically real PT-109 exist fleet   http news nationalgeographic.com news 2002 07 0709_020710_kennedypt109 htmlb luck build"

My four year old boy was bored with it in a day.  I think he will probably play with it more with friends who come over, but then again, only for a few minutes.  My six year old only gave it passing consideration.  This toy would probably be most entertaining for a toddler - 3 year old.  Just a word to the wise. It seems to be very well constructed, though a [less expensive toy] would probably have the same entertainment value (and eat less batteries).",3.0,Really Just For Toddlers,976147200,"12 7, 2000",Toys_and_Games,0,manufacturer say toy child year old think big stretch   year old boy bored day   think probably play friend come minute   year old give pass consideration   toy probably entertaining toddler 3 year old   word wise construct expensive toy probably entertainment value eat battery
